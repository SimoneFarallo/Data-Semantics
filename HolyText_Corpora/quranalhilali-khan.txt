In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful
Foreword

By Dr. 'Abdullah ibn 'Abd al-Muhsin al-Turki, Minister for Islamic Affairs,
Endowments, Da' wah and Guidance.
The Supervisor General of the Complex

Praise be to Allah, the Lord of the worlds, Who says in His Glorious Book,
"There has come to you from Allah a Light and a plain Book". and peace and
blessings of Allah be upon the noblest of the Prophets and Messengers, our
Prophet Muhammad who has said, "The best of you is he who learns the
Qur'an and teaches it".
Following the directives of the Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques, King
Fahd ibn 'Abd al-'Aziz Al Sa'Od, may Allah guard him, to give the book of Allah all
the importance due to it.its publication, its distribution throughout the world,
preparation of its commentary and translation of its meanings into different
languages of the world; and in view of the firm faith of the Ministry of Islamic
Affairs, Endowments, Da'wah and Guidance in the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in
the importance of translating the meanings of the Glorious Qur'an into all the
important languages of the world to enable the non-Arabic-speaking Muslims to
understand it, and in fulfilment of the injuction of the Prophet ;11s "Convey my
message even if it be one single ayah", and with the view to serve our Englishspeaking brethren, King Fahd Complex For the Printing of the Holy Qur'an at
al-Madinah al-Munawwarah has the pleasure to present the English-speaking
reader with this English translation by Dr.Muhammad Taqi-ud Din al-Hilali and
Dr.Muhammad Muhsin Khan, which has been revised on behalf of the Complex
by Fazal llahi Zahir, Dr. Amin ad-Din Abu Bakr, Dr. Wajih 'Abderrahman and
Dr. V.'Abdur Rahim.
We praise Allah subhanahu wa ta'ala for His favour to us in completing this
great work, praying Him to accept this as a sincere service for His sake, and for
the benefit of the Muslims.
We are aware of the fact that the translation of the meanings of the Glorious
Qur'an, however accurate it may be, must fall short of conveying the wealth of
meaning that the miraculous text of the original conveys; and that the meaning
conveyed by translation is only the sum total of what the translator has
understood from the text of the Glorious Book of Allah, and that it cannot escape
the defects and drawbacks that are inherent in every human endeavour. We,
therefore, request every reader of this translation to furnish the Complex with
any mistakes, omission or addition that he may find in it so that they may be
eliminated in subsequent editions in sha' Allah.
It is Allah Who bestows success, and guides to the Straight Path.

In the Name of Allah, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful

The Noble Qur'an - A Miracle from Allah
(to Prophet Muhammad ,.i..,J,.i- .. 1.;..,)

"And this Qur'an is not such as could ever be produced by other than
Allah (Lord of the heavens and the earth), but it is a confirmation of (the
revelation)which was before it [ i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the lnjeel
(Gospel)], and a full explanation of the Book (i.e. laws, decreed for mankind)
- wherein there is no doubt - from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinn,
and all that exists). " (',/.10:37)

~And whoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted
of him and in the Hereafter he will be one of the losers." ( V. 3:85)

no Prophet among the Prophets but was given miracles because of which
people had belief, but what I have been given is the Divine Revelation which
Allah has revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than
those of any other Prophet on the Day of Resurrection." ( Hadith No.379,

Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah ~ .ii 1 ..,...;,J : Some angels came to the
Prophet (Muhammad rJ-,, ..,i,. .ii 1 .;-) while he was sleeping. Some of them
said, "He is sleeping." Others said, "His eyes are sleeping but his heart is
awake.• Then they said, "There is an example for this companion of
yours." One of them said, "Then set forth an example for him." One of
them said, "He is sleeping." Another said, "His eyes are sleeping but his
heart is awake." Then they said, "His example is that of a man who built a
house and then offered therein a banquet and sent an inviter (messenger)
to invite the people. So whoever accepted the invitation of the inviter,
entered the house and ate of the banquet, and whoever did not accept the
invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house, nor did he eat of the
banquet." Then the angels said, "Interpret this parable to him so that he
may understand it.• One of them said, "He is sleeping.· The others said,
"His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake.• And then they said, "The
house stands for Paradise and the callmaker is Muhammad rJ-,, ..,i,. .ii 1 . ; and whoever obeys Muhammad, obeys Allah; and whoever disobeys
Muhammad, disobeys Allah. Muhammad separated the people (i.e.,

Q~~i!;_,:l}·:

r11 (V.1 :2) Lord: The actual word used in the Qur'an is Rabb . There is no proper
equivalent for Rabb in English language. It means the One and the Only Lord for
all the universe, its Creator, Owner, Organizer, Provider. Master, Planner,
Sustainer, Cherisher, and Giver of security. Rabb is also one of the Names of
Allah. We have used the word "Lord" as the nearest to Rabb. All occurrences of
"Lord" in the interpretation of the meanings of the Noble Our'An actually mean
Rabb and should be understood as such.
r21 (V.1 :2). Narrated Abu Sa,'id bin AI-Mu'alla: While I was praying in the mosque,
AIIAh's Messenger r.L- J ._,,!&- .ii I ._.--L.., called me but I did not respond to him. Later I
said, ·o Allah's Messenger, I was praying." He said , "Didn't ,Allah say - Answer
Allah (by obeying Him) and His Messenger when he r-L-- J ~ .ii 1 . } - calls you.· (V.
8:24). He then said to me, "I will teach you a Surah which is the greatest Surah in
the Our'An, before you leave the mosque.· Then he got hold of my hand, and when
he in.tended to leave (the mosque), I said to him, "Didn't you say to me, ·1 will teach
you a Surah which is the greatest Surah in the Qur'An?" He said, "AI-Hamdu lillahi
Rabbil-'~lamin (i.e. all the praises and thanks be to Allah, the Lord of the 'Alamin
(mankind, j inn and all that exists)], Surat AI-Fatihah which is As-Sab' AI-Mathani
(i.e. the seven repeatedly recited Verses) and the Grand Qur'an which has b.een
given to me." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No. 1).
r31 (V.1:6) Guidance is of two kinds:
a) Guidance of Taufiq i.e. totally from Allah, i.e. AIIAh opens one' s heart to receive
the truth (from disbelief to Belief in Islamic Monotheism).
b) Guidance of lrshad i.e. through preaching by Allah's Messengers and the pious
preachers who preach the truth i.e. Islamic Monotheism.
141 (V.1 :7) i.e. the way of the Prophets, the Siddiqun (i.e. those followers of the
Prophet, who were first and foremost to believe in him, like Abu Bakr As-Siddiq),
the martyrs and the righteous, (as All~h J,. J :,s- said : "And whoso obeys AIIAh and
the Messenger (Muh·a mmad ~ J ~ ..\ 1 ~ ), then they will be in the company of
those on whom Allah has bestowed His Grace, of the Prophets, the Siddiqun, the
martyrs, and the righteous. And how excellent these companions are! " (V.4:69)).

[This Hadith is quoted by At-Tirmidhi and Abu DAwQd].
1,1 (V.1 :7) Narration about Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail.
Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar l....f..:; .:ii 1 ._?J: The Prophet~ J ..,1; .:» 1 ..;.- met Zaid bin
'Amr bin Nufail in the bottom of (the valley of) Baldah before the descent of any
Divine revelation io the Prophet !"1:- J <-# .'ii 1 ..;.- • A meal was presented to the
Prophet ~ J '-# .'ii I u-'- but he refused to eat from it. (Then it was presented to
Zaid) who said, "I do not eat anything which you slaughter on your Nusub* in the
name of your idols etc. I eat only those ( animals) on which AIIAh's Name has
been mentioned at the time of (their) slaughtering." Zaid bin 'Amr used to criticise
the way Quraish used to slaughter their animals and used to say,"AIIAh has created
the sheep and He has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown the
grass for it from the earth; yet you slaughter it in others than the Name of AIIAh."
He used to say so, for he rejected that practice and considered it as something
abominable.
• Nusub: See the glossary.
Narrated lbn 'Umar l....f..:; .:» 1 ._? J: Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail went to Sham (the region
comprising Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan), enquiring about a true religion
to follow.
He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him about their religion. He said, ·1
intend to embrace your religion, so tell me something about it." The Jew said, "You
will not embrace our religion unless you receive your share of AIIAh's Anger." Zaid
said, ·1 do not run except from AIIAh's Anger, and I will never bear a bit of it if I
have the power to avoid it. Can you tell me of some other religion?" He said, "I do
not know any other religion except Han1f (lslAmic Monotheism)" Zaid enquired,
"What is Hanif?" He said, "Hanif is the religion of (the Prophet) Abraham (>1..-.ll ..,.l;,
he was neither a Jew nor a Christian, and he used to worship none but AIIAh
(Alone) lslAmic Monotheism." Then Zaid went out and met a Christian religious
scholar and told him the same (as before). The Christian said, "You will not
embrace our religion unless you get a share of AIIAh's Curse." Zaid replied, "I do
not run except from AIIAh's Curse, and I will never bear any of AIIAh's Curse and
His Anger if I have the power to avoid them. Will you tell me of some other
religion?" He replied, "I do not know any other religion except Hanif (lslAmic
Monotheism).· Zaid enquired, "What is Hanif?" He replied "Hanif is the religion of
(the Prophet) Abraham r'>',...)1 ..,.l; he was neither a Jew nor a Christian, (and he used
to worship none but AIIAh (Alone) - lslAmic Monotheism." When Zaid heard their
statement about (the religion of) Abraham, he left that place, and when he came
out, he raised both his hands and said, ·o AIIAh!. I make You my Witness that I am
on the religion of Abraham".
Narrated AsmA' bint Abi Bakr~.:» 1 ,.?J: I saw Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail standing
with his back against the Ka'bah and saying, "O people of Quraishi By AIIAh, none
amongst you is on the religion of Abraham except me." She added: He (Zaid) used
to preserve the lives of little girls; if somebody wanted to kill his daughter he would
say to him, "Do not kill her for I will feed her on your behalf." So he would take her,
and when she grew up nicely, he would say to her father, 'Now if you will (wish), I
will give her to you, and if you will (wish), I will feed her on your behalf." (Sahih AIBukhlJri, Vol.5, Hadith No.169).

I. Alif-Ldm-Mim. [These letters are one
of the miracles of the Qur'an and none but
Allah (Alone) knows their meanings.]

whereof there is no doubt, a guidance to
those who are Al-Muttaqun [the pious
believers of Islamic Monotheism who fear
Allah much (abstain from all kinds of sins
and evil deeds which He has forbidden) and

111 (V.2:3): AI-Ghaib: literally means a thing not seen . But this word includes vast
meanings: Belief in AIIAh, Angels, Holy Books, AIIAh's Messengers, Day of
Resurrection and AI-Qadar (Divine Pre-ordainments). It also includes what AIIAh
and His Messenger ..-I- J <# .i 1 ~ informed about the knowledge of the matters of
past, present, and future e.g., news about the creation of the heavens and earth,
botanical and zoological life, the news about the nations of the past, and about
Paradise and Hell.
121 (V.2:3): lqlJmat-as-SallJt;x..11 ~I.ii : The performance of SallJt (prayers). It means
that:
a).Each and every Muslim, male or female, is obliged to offer his SaMt (prayers)
regularly five times a day at the specified times; the male ir:i a mosque in
congregation and the female at home. As the Prophet r-1- J <#:., _;... has said :
"Order your children for SallJt (prayers) at the age of seven and beat them (about
it) at the age of ten." The chief (of a family, town, tribe, etc.) and the Muslim rulers
of a country are held responsible before AIIAh in case of non-futfillment of this
obligation by the Muslims under their authority.
b). One must offer the Sa/lJt (prayers) as the Prophet .r-1- J <# .ii 1 _;.., used to offer
them with all th~ir rules and regulations, i.e., standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting,
as he r-1-- J '-.# :. , ..,J.-,, has said: "Offer your SallJt (prayers) the way you see me
offering them (see Sahih AI-BukhlJri, Vol. 1, H.No. 604 and Vol. 9, H..No. 352). •

kind of property liable to ZaklJt of a Muslim to be paid yearly for the benefit of the
poor in the Muslim community. The payment of ZaklJt is obligatory as it is one of
the five pillars of lslAm. ZaklJt is the major economic means for establishing social
justice and leading the Muslim society to prosperity and security. [See Sahih AIBukhlJri, Vol. 2, Book of ZaklJt, No. 24)

Sunnah) 111 which has been sent down
(revealed) to you (Muhammad ~ .iii 1 .}-,:,

you [the Taurat (Torah) and the Injeel

etc.] and they believe with
certainty in the Hereafter. (Resurrection,

Paradise and Hell ).

6. Verily, those who disbelieve, it is the

them, they will not believe.
7. Allah has set a seal on their hearts and on
their hearing, (i.e. they are closed from accepting
Allah's Guidance), and on their eyes there is a
covering. Theirs will be a great torment.

8. And of mankind, there are some
(hypocrites) who say: "We believe in Allah
and the Last Day" while in fact they believe
not.

who believe, while they only deceive
themselves, and perceive (it) not!

they used to tell lies.
11. And when it is said to them: "Make
not mischief on the earth," they say: "We are
only peace-makers."
12. Verily! They are the ones who make
mischief, but they perceive not.
13. And when it is said to them
(hypocrites): "Believe as the ,people
(followers of Muhammad r-1..- J "# .iii I J...,,
Al-Ansdr and Al-Muhajirun) have believed,"
they say: "Shall we believe as the fools have
believed?" Verily, they are the fools, but they
know not.

14. And when they meet those who
believe, they say: "We believe," but when
they are alone with their Shaydtin ( devils polytheists, hypocrites), they say: "Truly, we
are with you; verily, we were but mocking."
15. Allah mocks at them and gives them
increase in their wrong-doing to wander
blindly.
16. These are they who have purchased
error for guidance, so their commerce was
profitless. And they were not guided.

things.
21. 0 mankind! Worship your Lord (Allah),
Who created you and those who were before
you so that you may become AI-Muttaqun
(the pious - See V.2:2).
22. Who has made the earth a resting
place for you, and the sky as a canopy, and
sent down water (rain) from the sky and
brought forth therewith fruits as a
provision for you. Then do not set up rivals
unto Allah (in worship) while you know
(that He Alone has the right to be
worshipped). 111

23. And if you (Arab pagans, Jews, and
Christians) are in doubt concerning that
which We have sent down (i.e. t~e Qur'an) to
Our slave (Muhammad ~ J ~ .ii 1 ~ ), then
produce a Surah (chapter) of the like thereof
and call your witnesses (supporters and
helpers) besides Allah, if you are truthful.
24. But if you do it not, and you can never
do it, then fear the Fire (Hell) whose fuel is
men and stones, prepared for the disbelievers.

25. And give glad tidings to those who
believe and do righteous good deeds, that for
them will be Gardens under which rivers flow
(Paradise). Every time they will be provided
with a fruit therefrom, they will say: "This is
what we were provided with before," and they
will be given things in resemblance (i.e. in the
same fonn but different in taste) and the11
shall have therein Azwdjun Mutahharatun 1 1
(purified mates or wives) and they will abide
therein forever.
(V.2:22) Narrated 'Abdullah ...:.so ..111 ._,...;, J: I asked the Prophet ~ J ~ .ii I c).-."What is the greatest sin in consideration with Allah?" He said, "That you set up a
rival unto Allah though He Alone created you." I said, "That is indeed a great sin."
Then I asked, "What is next?" He said, "To kill your son lest he should share your
food with you." I asked, "What is next?" He said, "To commit illegal sexual
intercourse with the wife of your neighbour." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith
No.4).

26. Verily, Allfilt is not ashamed to set
forth a parable even of a mosquito or so much
more when it is bigger (or less when it is
smaller) than it. And as for those who believe,
they know that it is the Truth from their Lord,
but as for those who disbelieve, they say:
"What did Allfilt intend by this parable?" By
it He misleads many, and many He guides
thereby. And He misleads thereby only those
who
are AI-FtisiP-'in (the rebellious,
disobedient to Allfilt 11 ).

27. Those who break Allfilt's Covenant
after ratifying it, and sever what Allfilt has
ordered to be joined (as regards Allfilt's
religion of Islamic Monotheism, and to
practise its laws on the earth and also as
regards keeping good relations with kith and
kin 121 ), and do mischief on earth, it is they
who are the losers.

28. How can you disbelieve in Allah?
seeing that you were dead and He gave you
life. Then He will give you death, then again
will bring you to life (on the Day of
Resurrection) and then unto Him you will
return. (See V.40: 11)
29. He it is Who created for you all that is
on earth. Then He rose over (lstawd) towards
the heaven and made them seven heavens and
He is the All-Knower of everything.
30. And (remember) when your Lord said
to the angels: "Verily, I am going to place
(mankind) generations after generations on

those who will make mischief therein and
shed blood, - while we glorify You with

31. And He taught Adam all the names (of
everything)111 , then He showed them to the
angels and said, "Tell Me the names of these
if you are truthful."
32. They (angels) said: "Glory be to You,
we have no knowledge except what you have
taught us. Verily, it is You, the All-Knower,
the All-Wise."

33. He said: "O Adam! Inform them of
their names," and when he had informed them
111 (V.2:31) The Statement of Allah JL..i: 'And He taught Adam all the names (of
everything).'
Narrated Anas ...:.s- 11 IJ"""J: The Prophet ~ J ._,is. 11 ._..L, said, "On the Day of
Resurrection the believers will assemble and say, 'Let us ask somebody to
intercede for us with our Lord.' So they will go to Adam and say, 'You are the father
of all the people, and AIIAh created you with His Own Hands, and ordered the
angels to prostrate themselves to you, and taught you the names of all things; so
please intercede for us with your Lord, so that He may relieve us from this place of
ours.' Adam will say, 'I am not fit for this (i.e. intercession for you).' Then Adam will
remember his sin and feel ashamed thereof. He will say, 'Go to NOh (Noah), for he
was the first Messenger AIIAh sent to the inhabitants of the earth.' They will go to
him and NOh (Noah) will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.' He will remember
his appeal to his Lord to do something of which he had no knowledge, then he will
feel ashamed thereof and will say, 'Go to Khalil-ur-Rahman* [i.e. lbrahtm
(Abraham)]. They will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking.
Go to MOsa (Moses), the slave to whom Allah spoke (directly) and gave him the
Taurat (Torah).' So they will go to him and he will say, 'I am not fit for this
undertaking.' and he will mention (his) killing a person who was not a killer, and so
he will feel ashamed thereof before his Lord, and he will say, 'Go to ·Isa (Jesus),
Allah's slave, His Messenger and AIIAh's Word and a spirit coming from Him.~· ·Isa
(Jesus) will say, 'I am not fit for this undertaking, go to Muhammad.,..l- J ..,is. .ii 1..;...
the slave of AIIAh whose past and future sins were forgiven by Allah.' So they will
come to me and I will proceed till I ask my Lord's Permission and I will be given
permission. When I see my Lord, I will fall down in prostration and He will let me
remain in that state as long He wishes and then I will be addressed.' (Muhammad!)
Raise your head. Ask, and your request will be granted; say, and your saying will
be listened to; intercede, and your intercession will be accepted.' I will raise my
head and praise Allah with a saying (i.e. invocation) He will teach me, and then I
will intercede. He will fix a limit for me (to intercede) whom I will admit into
Paradise. Then I will come back again to Allah, and when I see my Lord, the same
thing will happen to me. And then I will intercede and Allah will fix a limit for me (to
intercede) whom I will admit into Paradise, then I will come back for the third time;
and then I will come back for the fourth time, and will say, 'None remains in Hell
but those whom the Qur'an has imprisoned (in Hell) and who have been destined to
an eternal stay in Hell.'" (The compiler) Abu 'AbdullAh said: 'But those whom the

that I know the Ghaib (Unseen) in the
heavens and the earth, and I know what you
reveal and what you have been concealing?"
34. And (remember) when We said to the
angels: "Prostrate yourselves before Adam.".
And they prostrated except lb/is (Satan), he
refused and was proud and was one of the
disbelievers (disobedient to Allah).
35. And We said: "O Adam! Dwell you and
your wife in the Paradise and eat both of you
freely with pleasure and delight, of things therein
as wherever you will, but come not near this tree
or you both will be of the 7.alimun (wrongdoers)."

36. Then the Shaitan (Satan) made them
slip therefrom (the Paradise), and got them
out from that in which they were. We said:
"Get you down, all, with enmity between
yourselves. On earth will be a dwelling place
for you and an enjoyment for a time."
37. Then Adam received from his Lord

you were Ztilimun (polytheists and wrongdoers).

52. Then after that We forgave you so that
you might be grateful.
53. And (remember) when We gave Musil
(Moses) the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)]
and the criterion ( of right and wrong) so that
you may be guided aright."
54. And (remember) when Musil (Moses) said to
his people: "O my people! Verily, you have
wronged yourselves by worshipping the calf. So
tum in repentance to your Creator and kill
yourselves (the innocent kill the wrongdoers
among you), that will be better for you with your
Creator." Then He accepted your repentance.
Truly, He is the One Who accepts repentance, the
Most Merciful.

55. And (remember) when you said: "0
Musil (Moses)! We shall never believe in you
until we see Alliih plainly." But you were
seized with a thunder-bolt (lightning) while
you were looking.
56. Then We raised you up after your
death, so that you might be grateful.
57. And We shaded you with clouds and
sent down on you Al-Manna111 and the quails,
(saying): "Eat of the good lawful things We
have provided for you," (but they rebelled).
And they did not wrong Us but they wronged
themselves.
58. And (remember) when We said:
"Enter this town (Jerusalem) and eat
bountifully therein with pleasure and delight
wherever you wish, and enter the gate in
prostration (or bowing with humility) and say:
'Forgive us,' and We shall forgive you your
sins and shall increase (reward) for the gooddoers."

59. But those who did wrong changed the
word from that which had been told to them
for another, so We sent unon the wrong-doers
Rijz ( a punishment )' from the heaven
because of their rebelling against Allah's
obedience. (Tafsir At-Tabari ).
60. And (remember) when Mfisft (Moses)
asked for water for his people, We said:
"Strike the stone with your stick." Then
gushed forth therefrom twelve springs. Each
(group of) people knew its own place for
water. "Eat and drink of that which Allah has
provided and do not act corruptly, making
mischief on the earth."
61. And (remember) when you said, "O
Mfisft (Moses)! We cannot endure one kind of
food. So invoke your Lord for us to bring
forth for us of what the earth grows, its herbs,
its cucumbers, its Fum (wheat or garlic), its
lentils and its onions." He said, "Would you
exchange that which is better for that which is
lower? Go you down to any town and you
shall find what you want!" And they were
covered with humiliation and misery, and
they drew on themselves the Wrath of Allah.
That was because they used to disbelieve the
Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons,
signs, revelations etc.) of Allah and killed the
Prophets wrongfully. That was because they
disobeyed and used to transgress the bounds
(in their disobedience to Allah, i.e. commit
crimes and sins).

63. And (0 Children oflsrael, remember)
when We took your covenant and We raised
above you the Mount (saying): "Hold fast to
that which We have given you, and remember
that which is therein so that you may become
Al-Muttaqun (the pious - See V.2:2).
64. Then after that you turned away. Had
it not been for the Grace and Mercy of Allah
upon you, indeed you would have been
among the losers.

65. And indeed you knew those amongst
you who transgressed in the matter of the
Sabbath (i.e. Saturday). We said to them: "Be
you monkeys, despised and rejected."
66. So We made this punishment an
example to their own and to succeeding
generations and a lesson to those who are AlMuttaqun (the pious - See V.2:2).

67. And (remember) when Musa (Moses)
said to his people: "Verily, Allah commands
you that you slaughter a cow." They said,
"Do you make fun of us?" He said, "I take
Allah's Refuge from being among Al-Jahilun
(the ignorant or the foolish)."
68. They said, "Call upon your Lord for
us that He may make plain to us what it is!"
He said, "He says, 'Verily, it is a cow neither
too old nor too young, but (it is) between the
two conditions', so do what you are
commanded."
69. They said, "Call upon your Lord for
us to make plain to us its colour." He said,
"He says, 'It is a yellow cow, bright in its
colour, pleasing the beholders.' "
111 (V.2:62) This Verse (and Verse 5:69), mentioned in the Qur:an should not be
misinterpreted by the reader as mentioned by lbn Abbb ~ .:i> 1 er" 1 (Tafsir AtTabar,) that the provision of this Verse was abrogated by the Verse 3:85: "And
whosoever seeks a religion other than Islam, it will never be accepted of him, and

71. He [Musa (Moses)] said, "He says, 'It
is a cow neither trained to till the soil nor
water the fields, sound, having no other
colour except bright yellow.' " They said,
"Now you have brought the truth." So they
slaughtered it though they were near to not
doing it.
72. And (remember) when you killed a
man and fell into dispute among yourselves as
to the crime. But Allah brought forth that
which you were hiding.
73. So We said: "Strike him (the dead
man) with a piece of it (the cow)." Thus Allah
brings the dead to life and shows you His
Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons,
signs, revelations, etc.) so that you may
understand.
74. Then, after that, your hearts were
hardened and became as stones or even worse
in hardness. And indeed, there are stones out
of which rivers gush forth, and indeed, there
are of them (stones) which split asunder so
that water flows from them, and indeed, there
are of them (stones) which fall down for fear
of Allah. And Allah is not unaware of what
you do.
75. Do you (faithful believers) covet that
they will believe in your religion inspite of
the fact that a party of them (Jewish rabbis)
used to hear the Word of Allah [the Taurat
(Torah)], then they used to change it
knowingly after they understood it?
76. And when they (Jews) meet those who
believe (Muslims), they say, "We believe",
but when they meet one another in private,
they say, "Shall you (Jews) tell them

and do righteous good deeds, they are

and perform As-Saldt (lqdmat-as-Saldt), and
give Zakat. Then you slid back, except a few
of you, while you are backsliders. (Tafsir AlQurtubi ).
84. And (remember) when We took your
covenant (saying): Shed not the blood of your
(people), nor turn out your own people from
their dwellings. Then, (this) you ratified and
(to this) you bear witness.
85. After this, it is you who kill one
another and drive out a party of you from
their homes, assist (their enemies) against
them, in sin and transgression. And if they
come to you as captives, you ransom them,
although their expulsion was forbidden to
you. Then do you believe in a part of the
Scripture and reject the rest? Then what is the
recompense of those who do so among you,
except disgrace in the life of this world, and
on the Day of Resurrection they shall be
consigned to the most grievous torment. And
All!h is not unaware of what you do.
86. Those are they who have bought the
life of this world at the price of the Hereafter.
Their torment shall not be lightened nor shall
they be helped.

87. And indeed, We gave Musa (Moses)
the Book and followed him up with a
succession of Messengers. And We gave 'Isa
(Jesus), the son of Maryam (Mary), clear
signs and supported him with Ruh-ul-Qudus
[Jibrael (Gabriel) i')I._.JI 4....#]. Is it that
whenever there came to you a Messenger
with what you yourselves desired not, you
grew arrogant? Some you disbelieved and
some you killed.

Word)." Nay, Allah has cursed them for their
disbelief, so little is that which they believe.
89. And when there came to them (the
Jews), a Book (this Qur'an) from Allah
confirming what is with them [the Taurlit
(Torah) and the lnjeel (Gospel)], although
aforetime they had invoked,Allah (for coming
of Muhammad ~ J '-# .111 J-) in order to
gain victory over those who disbelieved, then
when there came to them that which they had
recognised, they disbelieved in it. So let the
Curse of Allah be on the disbelievers.

90. How bad is that for which they have
sold their ownselves, that they should
disbelieve in that which Allah has revealed
(the Qur'an), grudging that Allah should
reveal of His Grace unto whom He wills of
His slaves. So they have drawn on themselves
wrath upon wrath. And for the disbelievers,
there is disgracing torment.
91. And when it is said to them (the Jews),
"Believe in what Allah has sent down," they
say, "We believe in what was sent down to
us." And they disbelieve in that which came
after it, while it is the truth confirming
what is ~ith them. Say (0 Muhammad Ji-1--- J "-#' .11 I to them): "Why then have you
killed the Prophets of Allah aforetime, if you
indeed have been believers?"
92. And indeed Musa (Moses) came to
you with clear proofs, yet you worshipped the
calf after he left, and you were Z<ilimun
(polytheists and wrong-doers).

93. And (remember) when We took your
covenant and We raised above you the Mount
(saying), "Hold firmly to what We have given
you and hear (Our Word)." They said, "We
have heard and disobeyed." And their hearts
absorbed (the worship of) the calf because of
their disbelief. Say: "Worst indeed is that
which your faith enjoins on you if you are
believers."

Hereafter with Allah is indeed for you

specially and not for others, of mankind, then
long for death if you are truthful."
95. But they will never long for it because
of what their hands have sent before them
(i.e. what they have done). And Allah is AllAware of the Zalimun (polytheists and
wrong-doers).
96. And verily, you will find them (the Jews)
the greediest of mankind for life and (even
greedier) than those who ascribe partners to
Allah (and do not believe in Resurrection
- Majus, pagans, and idolaters). Everyone of
them wishes that he could be given a life of a
thousand years. But the grant of such life will
not save him even a little from (due)
punishment. And Allah is All-Seer of what
they do.
97. Say (0 Muhammad ~J ~ .iii I J:.,,):
"Whoever is an enemy to Jibrael (Gabriel)
(let him die in his fury), for indeed he has
brought it (this Qur'ful} down to your heart by
Allah's Permission, confirming what came
before it [i.e. the Taurat (Torah) and the
Injeel (Gospel)] and guidance and glad
tidings for the believers.
98. "Whoever is an enemy to Allah, His
Angels, His Messengers, Jibrael (Gabriel) and
Mikael (Michael), then verily, Allah is an
enemy to the disbelievers."

99. And indeed We have sent down to you
manifest Aydt (these Verses of the Qur'ful
which inform in detail about the news of the
Jews and their secret intentions, etc.), and
none disbelieve in them but Fdsiqun (those
who rebel against Allah's Command).
100. Is it not (the case) that every time they
make a covenant, some party among them throw
it aside? Nay! (the truth is:) most of them believe
not.
101. And when there came to them a
Messengei: from Allah (i.e. Muhammad J~ J ~ .'.ii I) confirming what was with them,
a party of those who were given the Scripture

threw away the Book of Allah behind their
backs as if they did not know!
102. They followed what the Shayiitin
(devils) gave out (falsely of the magic) in the
lifetime of Sulaiman (Solomon). Sulaiman did
not disbelieve, but the Shayiitin (devils)
disbelieved, teaching men magic and such
things that came down at Babylon to the two
angels, Han1t and Man1t, but neither of these
two (angels) taught anyone (such things) till
they had said, "We are only for trial, so
disbelieve not (by learning this magic from
us)." And from these (angels) people learn
that by which they cause separation between
man and his wife, but they could not thus
harm anyone except by Allah's Leave. And
they learn that which harms them and profits
them not. And indeed they knew that the
buyers of it (magic) would have no share in
the Hereafter. And how bad indeed was that
for which they sold their ownselves, if they but
knew.

103. And if they had believed and guarded
themselves from evil and kept their duty to
Allah, far better would have been the reward
from their Lord, if they but knew!
104. 0 you who ,believe! Say not (to the
Messenger r-1-- J ~ Ji I .}.;, ) Rd 'ina111 but say
Unzurna (make us under&tand) and hear. And
for the disbelievers there is a painful torment.
(See Verse 4:46)
105. Neither those who disbelieve among
the people of the Scripture (Jews and
Christians) nor AI-Mushrikun (the idolaters,
polytheists, disbelievers in the Oneness of
Allah, pagans, etc.) like that there should be
sent down unto you any good from your Lord.
But Allah chooses for His Mercy whom He
wills. And Allah is the Owner of Great
Bounty.

114. And who are more unjust than those

and mentioned much (i.e. prayers and
invocations, etc.) in Allah's mosques and
strive for their ruin? It was not fitting that
such should themselves enter them (Allah's

disgrace in this world, and they will have a

Zaid) who said, "I do not eat anything which you slaughter on your Nusub* in the
name of your idols, etc. I eat only those (animals meat) on which Allah's Name has
been mentioned at the time of (their) slaughtering." Zaid bin 'Amr used to criticise
the way Quraish used to slaughter their animals and used to say, "Allah has
created the sheep and He has sent the water for it from the sky, and He has grown
the grass for it from the earth; yet you slaughter it in others than the Name of
Allah." He used to say so, for he rejected that practice and considered it as
something abominable.
Narrated lbn 'Umar ~ .111 u""J: Zaid bin 'Amr bin Nufail went to Sham (the region
comprising Syria, Lebanon, Palestine and Jordan), enquiring about a true religion
to follow. He met a Jewish religious scholar and asked him about their religion. He
said, "I intend to embrace your religion, so tell me something about it." The Jew
said, "You will not embrace our religion unless you receive your share of Allah's
Anger." Zaid said, "I do not run except from AIIAh's Anger, and I will never bear a

which it stands). By Jih§d Islam is established, Allah's Word is made superior, (His
Word being La ilaha illall§h which means none has the right to be worshipped but
Allah), and His Religion (Islam) is propagated. By abandoning Jihad (may Allah
protect us from that) Islam is destroyed and the Muslims fall into an inferior
position; their honour is lost, their lands are stolen, their rule and authority vanish.
Jih§d is an obligatory duty in Islam on every Muslim, and he who tries to escape
from this duty, or does not in his innermost heart wish to fulfil this duty, dies with
one of the qualities of a hypocrite.

Fire, but Allfill invites (you) to Paradise and
Forgiveness by His Leave, and makes His
Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons,

they may remember.
222. They
ask
you

harmful thing for a husband to have a sexual
intercourse with his wife while she is having
her menses), therefore keep away from
women during menses and go not unto them
till they are purified (from menses and have
taken a bath). And when they have purified
themselves, then go in unto them as Allah
has ordained for you (go in unto them in any
manner as long as it is in their vagina).
Truly, Allfill loves those who tum unto Him

four months, then if they return ( change their
idea in this period), verily, Allah is OftForgiving, Most Merciful.

regards their marriage) for three menstrual
periods, and it is not lawful for them to
conceal what Allah has created in their
wombs, if they believe in Allah and the Last

to take them back in that period, if they wish
for reconciliation. And they (women) have
rights (over their husbands as regards living
expenses) similar (to those of their husbands)
over them (as regards obedience and respect)

has either to retain his wife in a handsome manner or to divorce her as Allah (, r

both parties fear that they would be unable to

These are the limits ordained by Allah, so do

thereafter until she has married another

236. There is no sin on you, if you divorce
women while yet you have not touched (had
sexual relation with) them, nor appointed
unto them their Mahr (bridal-money given by
the husband to his wife at the time of
marriage). But bestow on them (a suitable
gift), the rich according to his means, and the
poor according to his means, a gift of
reasonable amount is a duty on the doers of
good.
237. And if you divorce them before you
have touched (had a sexual relation with)
them, and you have appointed unto them the
Mahr (bridal-money given by the husband to
his wife at the time of marriage), then pay
half of that (Mahr), unless they (the women)
agree to forego it, or he (the husband), in
whose hands is the marriage tie, agrees to
forego and give her full appointed Mahr. And
to forego and give (her the full Mahr) is
nearer to At-Taqwa (piety, righteousness).
And do not forget liberality between
yourselves. Truly, Allah is All-Seer of what
you do.

246. Have you not thought about the
group of the Children of Israel after (the
time of) Musa (Moses)? When they said to
a Prophet of theirs, "Appoint for us a king
and we will fight in Allah's Way." He said,
"Would you then refrain from fighting, if
fighting was prescribed for you?" They
said, "Why should we not fight in Allah's
Way while we have been driven out of our
homes and our children (families have been
taken as captives)?" But when fighting was
ordered for them, they turned away, all
except a few of them. And Allah is AllAware of the Za/imun (polytheists and
wrong-doers).
247. And their Prophet (Samuel r~1 ~)
said to them, "Indeed Allah has appointed
TalOt (Saul) as a king over you." They
said, "How can he be a king over us when
we are fitter than him for the kingdom, and
he has not been given enough wealth." He
said: "Verily, Allah has chosen him above
you and has increased him abundantly in
knowledge and stature. And Allah grants
His kingdom to whom He wills. And Allah
is All-Sufficient for His creatures' needs,
All-Knower."
248. And their Prophet (Samuel r:>l-JI ~ )

kingdom is that there shall come to you Atwww.holybooks.com

249. Then when Tah1t (Saul) set out with
the army, he said: "Verily! Allah will try
you by a river. So whoever drinks thereof,
he is not of me, and whoever tastes it not, he
is of me, except him who takes (thereof) in
the hollow of his hand." Yet, they drank
thereof, all, except a few of them. So when
he had crossed it (the river), he and those
who believed with him, they said: "We have
no power this day against Jiilut (Goliath)
and his hosts." But those who knew with
certainty that they were going to meet Allah,
said: "How often a small group overcame a
mighty host by Allah's Leave?" And Allah
is with As-Sdbirim (the patient).
250. And when they advanced to meet
Jalut (Goliath) and his forces, they invoked:
"Our Lord! Pour forth on us patience, and
set firm our feet and make us victorious over
the disbelieving people."
251. So they routed them by Allah's
Leave and Dawud (David) killed Jalut
(Goliath), and Allah gave him [Diiwud

Tiilut (Saul) and Samuel] and AI-Hikmah

A. Narrated JAbir bin 'Abdulllllh L....., ..:ii, ~J: The Prophet rl-; ~ ..ii, _,1-,, said, "I have
been given five (things) which were not given to any one else before me:
a) AIIAh made me victorious by awe, (by His frightening my enemies) for a distance of
one month's journey.
b) The earth has been made for me (and for my followers) a place for praying and a
thing to purify (perform Tayammum), therefore anyone of my followers can pray
wherever he is, at the time of prayer.
c) The booty has been made Hal!JI (lawful) to me yet it was not lawful to anyone else
before me.
d) I have been given the right of intercession (on the Day of Resurrection).
e) Every Prophet used to be sent to his nation only, but I have been sent to all mankind."
(Sahih AI-Bukh!Jri, Vol.1, Hadith No.331 ).
B. Narrated Abu Hurairah ....., ..ii, <.r'"J: AIIAh's Messenger r-1-:-J ~ ..ii, ~ said, "My
similitude in comparison with the other Prophets before me is that of a man who has
built a house nicely and beautifully, except for a place of one brick in a corner. The
people go round about it and wonder at its beauty, but say: 'Would that this brick be put
in its place!' So I am that brick, and I am the last (end) of the Prophets." (Sahih AIBukh!Jri, Vol. 4, Hadith No. 735).
C. Narrated lbn Mas'Qd .w.: ..ii, ~J: As if I saw the Prophet rL-, ~ ..:ii 1 ..;-_ talking about
one of the Prophets whose nation had beaten him and caused him to bleed, while he
was cleaning the blood off his face and saying, ·o AIIAh! Forgive my nation, for they
have no knowledge." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Hadith No. 683).

Messenger ~, ~ ..:ii 1 ~ put a sheet over his face and when he felt hot, he would
remove it from his face. When in that state (of putting and removing the sheet) he said,
"May AIIAh's Curse be on the Jews and the Christians for they built places of worship at
the graves of their Prophets." (By that) he intended to warn (the Muslims) from what they
(i.e., Jews and Christians) had done. (Sahih Bukh!Jri, Vol. 4, Hadith No. 660).
E. Narrated Abu Hurairah ~ .:ii 1 ..r°J: The Prophet tl-, ~ .:it 1 ~ said, "The lsrlllelis used
to be ruled and guided by Prophets. Whenever a Prophet died, another would take over
his place. There will be no Prophet after me, but there will be caliphs who will increase in
number." The people asked, ·o AIIAh's Messenger! What do you order us (to do)?" He
said, "Obey the one who will be given the Bai'a - pledge first.* Fulfil their (i.e., the
caliphs') rights, for AIIAh will ask them about (any shortcomings in) ruling those whom
AIIAh has put under their guardianship." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vo!. 4, Hadith No. 661).
* If the Bai'a (pledge) is given to a caliph and after a while another caliph is given the
Bai'a (pledge) by some members of the society, the common Muslims should abide by
the Bai'a (pledge) given to the first caliph, for the election of the second is invalid.

253. Those Messengers! We preferred
some of them to others; to some of them
Allah spoke (directly); others He raised to
degrees (of honour); and to 'is! (Jesus), the
son of Maryam (Mary), We gave clear proofs
and evidences, and supported him with Ruhul-Qudus [Jibrael (Gabriel)]. If Allah had
willed, succeeding generations would not
have fought against each other, after clear
Verses of Allah had come to them, but they
differed - some of them believed and others
disbelieved. If Allah had willed, they would
not have fought against one another, but
Allah does what He likes.
254. 0 you who believe! Spend of that

a Day comes when there will be no

And it is the disbelievers who are the Zdlimun

the right to be worshipped but He), AlHayyul-Qayyuum (the Ever Living, the One
Who sustains and protects all that exists).
Neither slumber nor sleep overtakes Him. To
Him belongs whatever is in the heavens and
whatever is on the earth. Who is he that can
intercede with Him except with His
Permission? He knows what happens to them

happen to them in the Hereafter. And they
will never compass anything of His
Knowledge except that which He wills. His

Throne. The KursT mentioned in this Verse should be distinguished from the 'Arsh (Throne)

~ ..», ..;- said:
"The KursT compared to the 'Arsh is nothing but like a ring thrown out upon open space of
the desert.• If the Kursi extends over the entire universe, then how much greater is the
'Arsh. Indeed AIIAh, the Creator of both the Kursi and the 'Arsh, is the Most Great. lbn
Taimiyah said:
a) To believe in the Kursi.
b) To believe in the 'Arsh (Throne). It is narrated from Muhammad bin 'Abdullah and from
other religious scholars that the KursT is in front of the 'Arsh (Throne) and it is at the level of

256. There is no compulsion in religion.
Verily, the Right Path has become distinct
from the wrong path. Whoever disbelieves in
Taghut 111 and believes in Allah, then he has
grasped the most trustworthy handhold that
will never break. And Allah is All-Hearer,
All-Knower.
257. Allah is the Wa/i (Protector or
Guardian) of those who believe. He brings
them out from darkness into light. But as for
those who disbelieve, their Auliyd (supporters
and helpers) are Tdghut [false deities and
false leaders], they bring them out from light
into darkness. Those are the dwellers of the
Fire, and they will abide therein forever. (See

disputed with Ibrahim (Abraham) about his
Lord (Allah), because Allah had given him
the kingdom? When Ibrahim (Abraham) said

life and causes death." He said, "I give life
and cause death." Ibrahim (Abraham) said,

then bring it you from the west." So the

Allah will benefit you). When you go to your bed, recite Ayat -ul-Kursi, (2:255) for then there
will be a guard from Allah who will protect you all night long, and Satan will not be able to
come near you till dawn." (When the Prophet rL, ~ .:l!r .;- heard the story) he said (to me),
"He (who came to you at night) told you the truth although he is a liar; and it was Satan."

The word
Taghut covers a wide range of meanings: It means anything worshipped other than the
Real God (Allsh),but the one who does not accept to be worshipped will not be considered
as a TaghDt, i.e. all the false deities. It may be Satan, devils, idols, stones, sun, stars,
angels, human beings, who were falsely worshipped and taken as TaghOts. Likewise saints,
graves, rulers, leaders, etc., are falsely worshipped and wrongly followed. Sometimes
"TaghOt" means a false judge who gives a false judgement (see V.4:60). [See Tafsir lbn
Kathir, and (V.4:51 )].

Allah guides not the people, who are Zdlimun
(wrong-doers).
259. Or like the one who passed by a town
and it had tumbled over its roofs. He said:
"Oh! How will Allah ever bring it to life after
its death?" So Allah caused him to die for a
hundred years, then raised him up (again). He
said: "How long did you remain (dead)?" He
(the man) said: "(Perhaps) I remained (dead)
a day or part of a day". He said: "Nay, you
have remained (dead) for a hundred years,
look at your food and your drink, they show
no change; and look at your donkey! And
thus We have made of you a sign for the
people. Look at the bones, how We bring
them together and clothe them with flesh".
When this was clearly shown to him, he said,
"I know (now) that Allah is Able to do all
things."
260. And (remember) when Ibrahim
(Abraham) said, "My Lord! Show me how
You give life to the dead." He (Allah) said:
"Do you not believe?" He [Ibrahim
(Abraham)] said: "Yes (I believe), but to be
stronger in Faith." He said: "Take four birds,
then cause them to incline towards you (then
slaughter them, cut them into pieces), and
then put a portion of them on every hill, and
call them, they will come to you in haste. And
know that Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise."

And Allah is All-Sufficient for His creatures'

263. Kind words and forgiving of faults
are better than Sadaqah (charity) followed by
injury. And Allah is Rich (Free of all needs)
and He is Most-Forbearing.
264. 0 you who believe! Do not render in
vain your Sadaqah (charity) by reminders of
your generosity or by injury, like him who
spends his wealth to be seen of men, and he
does not believe in Allah, nor in the Last Day.
His likeness is the likeness of a smooth rock
on which is a little dust; on it falls heavy rain
which leaves it bare. They are not able to do
anything with what they have earned. And
Allah does not guide the disbelieving people.
265. And the likeness of those who spend
their wealth seeking Allah's Pleasure while
they in their ownselves are sure and certain
that Allah will reward them (for their
spending in His Cause), is the likeness ofa
garden on a height; heavy rain falls on it and
it doubles its yield of harvest. And if it does
not receive heavy rain, light rain suffices it.
And Allah is All-Seer (know'> well) of what
you do.
266. Would any of you wish to have a
garden with date-palms and vines, with rivers
flowing underneath, and all kinds of fruits for
him therein, while he is striken with old age,
and his children are weak (not able to look
after themselves), then it is struck with a fiery
whirlwind, so that it is burnt? Thus does
Allah make clear His Aydt {proofs, evidences,
verses) to you that you may give thought111 •

267. 0 you who believe! Spend of the
good things which you have (legally) earned,

bad to spend from it, (though) you would not
accept it save if you close your eyes and

(Free of all needs), and Worthy of all praise.

poverty and orders you to commit Fahshd
(evil deeds, illegal sexual intercourse, sins);
whereas Allfill promises you Forgiveness
from Himself and Bounty, and Allfill is AllSufficient for His creatures' needs, AllKnower.
269. He grants Hikmah 111 to whom He
pleases, and he, to whom Hikmah is granted,
is indeed granted abundant good. But none
remember (will receive admonition) except
men of understanding.
270. And whatever you spend for
spendings (e.g., in Sadaqah - charity for
Allfill's Cause) or whatever vow you make, be
sure Allah knows it all. And for the Zdlimun
(wrong-doers) there are no helpers.
271. If you disclose your Sadaqdt (almsgiving), it is well; but if you conceal them and
give them to the poor, that is better for you.
(Allfill) will expiate you some of your sins.
And Allfill is Well-Acquainted with what you
do.
272. Not upon you (Muhammad .ii , ~
r1,--, 4La) is their guidance, but Allfill guides
whom He wills. And whatever you spend in
good, it is for yourselves, when you spend not
except seeking Allfill's Countenance. And
whatever you spend in good, it will be repaid
to you in full, and you shall not be wronged.

273. (Charity is) for Fuqard (the poor),
who in Allah's Cause are restricted (from
travel), and cannot move about in the land
(for trade or work). The one who knows them
not, thinks that they are rich because of their
modesty. You may know them by their mark,

they do not beg of people at all. 111 And
whatever you spend in good, surely, Allfill
knows it well.

Allfill's Cause) by night and day, in secret and
in public, they shall have their reward with
their Lord. On them shall be no fear, nor shall
they grieve. 121
275. Those who eat Rib,i31 (usury) will
not stand (on the Day of Resurrection) except
like the standing of a person beaten by
Shaitan (Satan) leading him to insanity. That
is because they say: "Trading is only like
Riha (usury)," whereas Allfill has permitted
trading and forbidden Riha (usury). So
whosoever receives an admonition from his
Lord and stops eating Riha (usury) shall not
be punished for the past; his case is for Allfill
(to judge); but whoever returns [to Riha
(usury)], such are the dwellers of the Fire they will abide therein.

111 (V.2:273) The Arabic word 1/hflfa literally means: "to beg with importunity," but lmilm
Tabari in his Tafsir and the majority of the religious scholars agree that the Verse means:
"They do not beg of people at all."
121 (V.2:274) Narrated Abu Hurairah ...., .iJ 1 ..rJ'J: The Prophet ,.i-, ~ .iJ I J- said, "Seven
people will be shaded by Allilh under His Shade on the Day (i.e. the Day of Resurrection)
when there will be no shade except His. They are:
a) a just ruler;
b) a young man who has been brought up in the worship of Allilh, [i.e.worships Allah
(Alone) sincerely from his childhood];
c) a man whose heart is attached to the mosques (who offers the five compulsory
congregational prayers in the mosques);
d) two persons who love each other only for Allah's sake, and they meet and part in Allilh's
Cause only;
e) a man who refuses the call of a charming woman of noble birth for illegal sexual
intercourse with her and says: I fear Allah;
f) a person who practises charity so secretly that his left hand does not know what his right
hand has given (i.e., nobody knows how much he has given in charity).
g) a person who remembers Allah in seclusion and his eyes become flooded with tears.·
Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.2, Hadith No.504).

more of the same kind of goods of inferior quality, e.g., dates of superior quality for dates of

and tear off that side of his face to the back (of the neck), and similarly tear his nose from
front to back, and his eye from front to back. Then he turned to the other (second) side of
the man's face and did just as he had done with the first side. He hardly completed that
(second) side when the first side returned to its normal state. Then he returned to it to
repeat what he had done before. I said to my two companions, 'Subhan AllfJh! Who are
these two persons?' They said to me, 'Proceed!' So we proceeded and came across
something like a Tannur (a kind of baking oven, a pit usually clay-lined for baking bread)." I

Prophet r--:'.J <41,: .ii, ~ added, ·we looked into it and found naked men and women, and
behold, a flame of fire was reaching to them from underneath, and when it reached them,

his mouth whereupon he went swimming again. Then again he (the former) returned to him
(the latter), and every time the former returned, he opened his mouth, and the latter threw a
stone into his mouth, (and so on) the performance was repeated. I asked my two
companions, 'Who are these two persons?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' And we
proceeded till we came to a man with a repulsive appearance, the most repulsive
appearance you ever saw a man having! Beside him there was a fire, and he was kindling it
and running around it. I asked my companions, 'Who is this (man)?' They said to me,
'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we reached a garden of deep green dense
vegetation, having all sorts of spring colours. In the midst of the garden there was a very tall
man, and I could hardly see his head because of his great height, and around him there
were children in such a large number as I have never seen. I said to my companions, 'Who
is this?' They replied, 'Proceed! Proceed!' So we proceeded till we came to a majestic huge
garden, greater and better than I have ever seen! My two companions said to me, 'Ascend
up' and I ascended up.· The Prophet r!--J ",fl,, .ii, J- added, "So we ascended till we reached
a city built of gold and silver bricks, and we went to its gate and asked (the gatekeeper) to
open the gate, and it was opened and we entered the city and found in it men with one side
of their bodies as handsome as the most handsome person you have ever seen, and the
other side as ugly as the ugliest person you have ever seen. My two companions ordered
those men to throw themselves into the river. Behold, there was a river flowing across (the
city), and its water was like milk in whiteness. Those men went and threw themselves in it
and then returned to us after the ugliness (of their bodies) had disappeared, and they
became in the best shape." The Prophet r-1-:::J ",fl,, .ii, ..,w further added, "My two companions
(angels) said to me: 'This place is the 'Adn Paradise, and that is your place.' I raised up my
sight, and behold, there I saw a palace like a white cloud! My two companions said to me:
'That (palace) is your place' I said to them: 'May Allah bless you both! Let me enter it.' They
replied, 'As for now, you will not enter it, but you shall enter it (one day).' I said to them, 'I
have seen many wonders tonight. What does all that mean which I have seen?' They
replied, 'We will inform you: As for the first man you came upon whose head was being
smashed with the rock, he is the symbol of the one who studies the Qur'an, and then
neither recites it, nor acts on its orders, and sleeps, neglecting the enjoined prayers. As for
the man you came upon, whose sides of mouth, nostrils, and eyes were torn off from front
to back, he is the symbol of the man who goes out of his house in the morning and tells lies
that are spread all over the world. And those naked men and women whom you saw in a
construction resembling an oven, they are the adulterers-fornicators and the adulteressesfornicatresses, and the man whom you saw swimming in the river, and was given a stone
to swallow, is the eater of RibfJ (usury), and the bad looking man whom you saw near the
fire kindling it and going around it, is Ml!lik; the gatekeeper of Hell, and the tall man whom
you saw in the garden, is lbrAhim (Abraham), and the children around him are those who
die on AI-Fitrah (the Islamic Faith of Monotheism ).' • The narrator added : Some Muslims

fighting in the Cause of Allah, and as for the
other, (they) were disbelievers. They (the
believers) saw them (the disbelievers) with

they were thrice their number). And Allah

Verily, in this is a lesson for those who

20. So if they dispute with you
(Muhammad ri-J ~ .JJ1 .,.i..,) say: "I have
submitted myself to Allah (in Islam), and (so
have) those who follow me." And say to those
who were given the Scripture (Jews and
Christians) and to those who are illiterates
(Arab pagans): "Do you (also) submit

111 (V.3:64) Narrated lbn 'Abbas ~ ..:u 1 -.,.J: Abu Sufyan narrated to me personally, saying,
"I set out during the truce that had been concluded between me and Allah's Messenger..;..
,.i..., 41s .:ii 1. While I was in Sham, a letter sent by the Prophet ,i-, ~ .:ii 1.;... was broughfto
Heraclius. Dihya AI-Kalbi had brought and given it to the governor of Busra, and the latter
forwarded it to Heraclius. Heraclius said, 'Is there anyone from the people of this man who
claims to be a Prophet?' The people replied, 'Yes,' so, along with some other Quraishi men,
I was called and we entered upon Heraclius, and we were seated in front of him. Then he
said, 'Who amongst you is the nearest relative to the man who claims to be a Prophet?' I
(Abu Sufyan) replied: 'I am the nearest relative to him from amongst the group.' So they
made me sit in front of him and made my companions sit behind me. Then he called upon
his translator and said (to him). 'Tell them (i.e. Abu Sufyan's companions) that I am going
to ask him (i.e. Abu Sufyan) regarding that man who claims to be a Prophet. So, if he tells
me a lie, they should contradict him (instantly).' By Allah, had I not been afraid that my
companions would consider me a liar, I would have told lies. Heraclius then said to his
translator, 'Ask him: What is his (i.e. the Prophet's) family status amongst you?' I said, 'He
belongs to a noble family amongst us.' Heraclius said, 'Was any of his ancestors a king?' I
said, 'No'. He said, 'Did you ever accuse him of telling lies before his saying what he has
said?' I said, 'No'. He said, 'Do the nobles follow him or the poor people?' I said, 'It is the
poor who follow him.' He said, 'Is the number of his followers increasing or decreasing?' I
said, 'They are increasing.' He said, 'Does anyone renounce his religion (i.e. Islam) after
embracing it, being displeased with it?' I said, 'No.' He said, 'Did you fight with him?' I
replied, 'Yes.' He said, 'How was your fighting with him?' I said, 'The fighting between us
was undecided and victory was shared by him and us in turns. He inflicts casualties upon
us and we inflict casualties upon him.' He said, 'Did he ever betray?' I said, 'No, but now we
are away from him in this truce and we do not know what he will do in it.' "Abu Sufyan
added, "By Allah, I was not able to insert in my speech a word (against him) except that.
Heraclius said, 'Did anybody else (amongst you) ever claim the same (i.e. to be Allah's
Prophet) before him?' I said, 'No'. Then Heraclius told his translator to tell me (i.e. Abu
Sufyan), 'I asked you about his family status amongst you, and you told me that he comes
from a noble family amongst you. Verily, all Messengers come from the noblest family
among their people. Then I asked you whether any of his ancestors was a king, and you
denied that.Thereupon I thought that had one of his forefathers been a king, I would have

said that he (i.e. Muhammad ,1-J ~ .ii 1 ~ ) was seeking to rule the kingdom of his
forefathers. Then I asked you regarding his followers, whether they were the noble or the
poor among the people, and you said that they were only poor (who follow him). In fact,
such are the followers of the Messengers. Then I asked you whether you have ever
accused him of telling lies before he said what he said, and your reply was in the negative.
Therefore, I took for granted that a man who did not tell a lie about others, could never tell a
lie about Allah. Then I asked you whether anyone of his followers had renounced his
religion (i.e. Islam) after embracing it, being displeased with it, and you denied that. And
such is faith when its delight enters the heart and mixes with it completely. Then I asked
you whether his followers were increasing or decreasing. You claimed that they were
increasing, that is the way of true faith till it is complete. Then I asked you whether you had
ever fought with him, and you claimed that you had fought with him and the battle between
you and him was undecided and the victory was shared by you and him in turns; he inflicted
casualties upon you and you inflicted casualties upon them. Such is the case with the
Messengers, they are put to trials and the final victory is for them. Then I asked you
whether he has ever betrayed anyone; you claimed that he had never betrayed. Indeed,
Messengers never betray. Then I asked you whether anyone had said this statement before
him; and you denied that. Thereupon I thought if somebody had said that statement before
him, then I would have said that he was but a man copying some sayings said before him.'
Abu Sufyan said, "Heraclius then asked me, 'What does he order you to do?' I said, 'He
orders us (to offer) prayers and (to pay) Zak§t, and to keep good relationship with the kith
and kin, and to be chaste.' Then Heraclius said, 'If whatever you have said is true, then he
is really a Prophet. I knew that he (i.e. the Prophet f-,J ~ .ii 1 ~ ) was going to appear, but
I never thought that he would be from amongst you. If I were certain that I can reach him, I
would like to meet him and if I were with him, I would wash his feet; and his kingdom will
expand (surely) to what is under my feet.' Then Heraclius asked for the letter of Allah's
Messenger f-,J ~ .ii 1 ~ and read it, wherein was written:
In the Name of All§h, the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
(This letter is) from Muhammad, Messenger of Allah, to Heraclius, the sovereign of
Byzantine
Peace be upon him who follows the Right Path. Now then, I call you to embrace Islam.
Embrace Islam and you will be saved (from Allah's punishment); embrace Islam, and Allah
will give you a double reward, but if you reject this, you will be responsible for the sins of all
the people of your kingdom: (Allah's Statement):
people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)! Come to a word that is just between us
and you, that we worship none but Allah (Alone) ... bear witness that we are Muslims."
(3:64).
"When he finished reading the letter, voices grew louder near him and there was a great
hue and cry, and we were ordered to go out." Abu Sufyan added, "While coming out, I said
to my companions, 'The matter of lbn Abu Kabshah* (i.e. Muhammad ~J ~ .ii 1 ~ ) has
become so prominent that even the king of Banu AI-Asfar (i.e. the Romans) is afraid of
him.' So I continued to believe that Allah's Messenger ~J ~ .ii 1 .;- would be victorious, till
Allah made me embrace Islam." Az-Zuhri said, "Heraclius then invited all the chiefs of the
Byzantine and had them assembled in his house and said, 'O group of Byzantine! Do you
wish to have a permanent success and guidance and that your kingdom should remain with
you?' (Immediately after hearing that), they rushed towards the gate like onagers, but they
found them closed. Heraclius then said, 'Bring them back to me.' So he called them and
said, 'I just wanted to test the strength of your adherence to your religion. Now I have
observed of you that which I like.' Then the people fell in prostration before him and
became pleased with him." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.75).

by Abu Sufyan out of hostility against the Prophet f-,J ~ .ii 1 ~ -

is Faith?" Allah's Messenger rJ-,J <,iL: .ii 1 ~ replied, "Faith is to believe in Allah, His angels,
(the) meeting with Him, His messengers, and to believe in Resurrection."* Then he further
asked, "What is Islam?" Allah's Messenger rJ-,J <,iL: .ii 1 ~ replied, "To worship Allah Alone
and none else, to perform As-Sa/at (lqamat-as-Salat), to give the Zakat and to observe
Saum (fasts) during the month of Ramadan,"** then he further asked, "What is /hsan
(perfection)?" Allah's Messenger r1-J <,iL: .ii 1 ~ replied, "To worship Allah ~ J r as if you
see Him, and if you cannot achieve this state of devotion then you must consider that He is
looking at you." Then he further asked, "When will the Hour be established?" Allah's
Messenger r!-J ~ .ii 1 ..,.,_., replied, "The answerer has no better knowledge than the
questioner. But I will inform you about its portents:
(1) When a slave (lady) gives birth to her master.
(2) When the shepherds of black camels start boasting and competing with others in the
construction of higher buildings. And the Hour is one of the five things which nobody knows
except Allah.
The Prophet r!-J ~ .ii 1 ..,.,_., then recited: "Verily, the knowledge of the Hour is with Allah
(Alone)." (31 :34). Then that man (Gabriel r:,1...J1 <,,L:) left and the Prophet rJ-,J ",!l,: .ii 1 ~ asked
his Companions to call him back, but they could not see him. Then the Prophet <,iL: .ii 1 ~
rJ-,J said, "That was (angel) Gabriel r:,1...J1 <,iL: who came to teach the people their religion."
Abu 'Abdullah w .ii 1 ..r4J said: He (the Prophet rJ-,J ",!l,: .ii 1 ~ ) considered all that as a part
of faith. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No.47).
• In this Hadith, only 4 articles are mentioned, while in another Hadith, 6 articles are
mentioned: (i) Allah, (ii) His Angels, (iii) His Books (The Torah, The Gospel, The Qur'an and
all the other Holy Books revealed by Allah), (iv) His Messengers, (v) Day of Resurrection
and (vi) AI-Qadar (Divine Pre-ordainments), i.e. whatever Allah has ordained, must come to

151. We shall cast terror into the hearts
of those who disbelieve, because they joined
others in worship with Allah, for which He
had sent no authority; their abode will be the
Fire and how evil is the abode of the
Zdlimun (polytheists and wrong-doers).
152. And Allah did indeed fulfil His
Promise to you when you were killing them
(your enemy) with His Permission; until (the
moment) you lost your courage and fell to
disputing about the order, and disobeyed
after He showed you (of the booty) which
you love. Among you are some that desire
this world and some that desire the
Hereafter. Then He made you flee from
them (your enemy), that He might test you.
But surely, He forgave you, and Allah is
Most Gracious to the believers.
153. (And remember) when you ran
away (dreadfully) without even casting a
side glance at anyone, and the Messenger
(Muhammad rl-J ~.ii, _,i...) was in your rear
calling you back. There did Allah give you
one distress after another by way of requital
to teach you not to grieve for that which had
escaped you, nor for that which had befallen
you. And Allah is Well-Aware of all that
you do.
154. Then after the distress, He sent
down security for you. Slumber overtook a
party of you, while another party was
thinking about themselves (as how to save
their ownselves, ignoring the others and the
Prophet r-'J ~.ii, _,i...) and thought wrongly
of Allah - the thought of ignorance. They
said, "Have we any part in the affair?" Say
(0 Muhammad r--'J ~.ii, _,i...): "Indeed the
affair belongs wholly to Allah." They hide
within themselves what they dare not reveal
to you, saying: "If we had anything to do
with the affair, none ofus would have been
killed here." Say: "Even if you had remained
in your homes, those for whom death was
decreed would certainly have gone forth to
the place of their death," but that Allah

might test what is in your breasts; and to
purify111 that which was in your hearts (sins),
and Allah is All-Knower of what is in (your)
breasts.
155. Those of you who turned back on
the day the two hosts met (i.e. the battle of
Uhud), it was Shaitan (Satan) who caused
them to backslide (run away from the
battlefield) because of some (sins) they had
earned. But Allah, indeed, has forgiven
them. Surely, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most
Forbearing.
156. 0 you who believe! Be not like
those who disbelieve (hypocrites) and who
say to their brethren when they travel
through the earth or go out to fight: "If they
had stayed with us, they would not have died
or been killed," so that Allah may make it a
cause of regret in their hearts. It is Allah that
gives life and causes death. And Allah is
All-Seer of what you do.
157. And if you are killed or die in the
Way of Allah, forgiveness and mercy from
Allah are far better than all that they amass
(of worldly wealths ).
158. And whether you die, or are killed,
verily, unto Allah you shall be gathered.
159. And by the Mercy of Allah, you
dealt with them gently. And had you been
severe and harsh-hearted, they would have
broken away from about you; so pass over
(their faults), and ask (Allah's) Forgiveness
for them; and consult them in the affairs.
Then when you have taken a decision, put
your trust in Allah, certainly, Allah loves
those who put their trust (in Him).

overcome you; and if He forsakes you, who

whosoever deceives his companions as

Mujahid said, "(Make us) a community that follows the Muttaqun (righteous) people who

things which I love for myself and for my brothers, i.e. this Sunnah (the legal ways of the
Prophet r-1-'.J .._.i., .ll 1 ..,.i.., ) which they should learn and ask about; the Qur'An which they
should understand and ask the people about; and that they should leave the people except
when intending to do good (for them)." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Chap. 2, P. 282).
A) Narrated Hudhaifah: AIIAh's Messenger rf-,J <.,1; .ll 1..)- said to us, "Certainly AI-Amanah

descended from the heavens and settled in the roots of the hearts of men (faithful

said, "He is sleeping." The others said, "His eyes are sleeping but his heart is awake." Then
they said, "His example is that of a man who has built a house and then offered therein a
banquet and sent an inviter (messenger) to invite the people. So whosoever accepted the
invitation of the inviter, entered the house and ate of the banquet, and whoever did not
accept the invitation of the inviter, did not enter the house, nor did he eat of the banquet."
Then the angels said, "Interpret this parable to him so that he may understand it." Some of

proceeding stealthily till they were safe, while another group of them disbelieved him and
stayed at their places till morning when the army came upon them, and killed and ruined
them completely. So this is the example of that person who obeys me and follows that truth

the people (hypocrites) said, "Verily, the
people (pagans) have gathered against you

Allah and speak right words.

property of orphans, they eat up only fire
into their bellies, and they will be burnt in

(V.4:5) Narrated AI-Mughirah bin Shu'bah w .,ji I cr4; : The Prophet r!---J ~ .,ji I J... said,
"Allah has forbidden for you: (1) To be undutiful to your mothers, (2) to bury your daughters
alive, (3) not to pay the rights of the others (e.g. Zakat, charity) and (4) to beg of men (i.e.
begging). And Allah has hated for you: (1) Sinful and useless talk like backbiting or that you
talk too much about others, (2) to ask too many questions, (in disputed religious matters)
and (3) to waste the wealth (by extravagance with lack of wisdom and thinking). (Sahih A/Bukhari, Vol. 3, Had1th No. 591 ).

11. Allfill commands you as regards your
children's (inheritance): to the male, a
portion equal to that of two females; if
(there are) only daughters, two or more,
their share is two-thirds of the inheritance; if
only one, her share is a half. For parents, a
sixth share of inheritance to each if the
deceased left children; if no children, and
the parents are the (only) heirs, the mother
has a third; if the deceased left brothers
(or sisters), the mother has a sixth. {The
distribution in all cases is) after the payment
of legacies he may have bequeathed or
debts. You know not which of them,
whether your parents or your children, are
nearest to you in benefit; (these fixed
shares) are ordained by Allah. And Allah is
Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.
12. In that which your wives leave, your
share is a half if they have no child; but if
they leave a child, you get a fourth of that
which they leave after payment of legacies
that they may have bequeathed or debts. In
that which you leave, their (your wives)
share is a fourth if you leave no child; but if
you leave a child, they get an eighth of that
which you leave after payment of legacies
that you may have bequeathed or debts. If
the man or woman whose inheritance is in
question has left neither ascendants nor
descendants, but has left a brother or a
sister, each one of the two gets a sixth; but if
more than two, they share in a third, after
payment of lagacies he (or she) may have
bequeathed or debts, so that no loss is
caused (to anyone). This is a Commandment
from Allfill; and Allfill is Ever All-Knowing,
Most-Forbearing.
13. These are the limits (set by) Allfill (or
ordainments as regards laws of inheritance),
and whosoever obeys Allfill and His
Messenger (Muhammad tl-J ~ .:ii 1 .;.) will
be admitted to Gardens under which rivers
flow (in Paradise), to abide therein, and that
will be the great success.

14. And whosoever disobeys Allfill and
His Messenger (Muhammad ri-, ,i,p .Ji,.;..),
and transgresses His limits, He will cast him
into the Fire, to abide therein; and he shall
have a disgraceful torment.

15. And those of your women who
commit illegal sexual intercourse, take the
evidence of four witnesses from amongst
you against them; and if they testify, confine
them (i.e. women) to houses until death
comes to them or Allfill ordains for them
some (other) way. 111
16. And the two persons (man and
woman) among you who commit illegal
sexual intercourse, hurt them both. 121 And if
they repent (promise Allah that they will
never repeat, i.e. commit illegal sexual
intercourse and other similar sins) and do
righteous good deeds, leave them alone.
Surely, Allfill is Ever All-Forgiving (the One
Who forgives and accepts repentance), (and
He is) Most Merciful.

17. Allfill accepts only the repentance of
those who do evil in ignorance and
foolishness and repent soon afterwards; it is
they whom Allah will forgive and Allfill is
Ever All-Knower, All-Wise.
18. And ofno effect is the repentance of
those who continue to do evil deeds until
death faces one of them and he says: "Now I
repent;" nor of those who die while they are
disbelievers. For them We have prepared a
painful torment.

a Qintar (of gold i.e. a great amount as

while you have gone in unto each other,
and they have taken from you a firm and

22. And marry not women whom your
fathers married, except what has already

hateful, and an evil way.

daughters, your foster mothers who gave

there is no sin on you if you have not gone

if he says, 'If such thing is not true then I am a Jew,' he is really a Jew if he is a liar). And
whoever commits suicide with a piece of iron, will be punished with the same piece of iron
in the Hell-fire.·
Narrated Jundub: The Prophet ,.i.., ~ .:ii 1. ; - said, "A man was inflicted with wounds and he
commited suicide, and so AIIAh said: My slave has caused death on himself hurriedly, so I
forbid Paradise for him.· (Sahih AI-BukMri, Vol. 2, Hadlth No. 445).

because they spend (to support them) from

are devoutly obedient (to Allah and to their
husbands), and guard in the husband's
absence what Allah orders them to guard (e.g.
their chastity, their husband's property). As to
those women on whose part you see
ill-conduct, admonish them (first), (next),
refuse to share their beds, (and last) beat them
(lightly, if it is useful); but if they return to
obedience, seek not against them means (of
annoyance). Surely, Allah is Ever Most High,

Him (in worship); and do good to parents,
kinsfolk, orphans, Al-Masdkin (the poor), the
neighbour who is near of kin, the neighbour
who is a stranger, the companion by your
side, the wayfarer (you meet), and those

"Indeed Allah has favoured me in that I was

between you and him - "Oh! I wish I had

cause will have the reward thereof, and
whosoever intercedes for an evil cause will
have a share in its burden. And Allah is Ever
All-Able to do (and also an All-Witness to)

Ever a Careful Account Taker of all things. 111

87. Allah! La ildha ilia Huwa (none has
the right to be worshipped but He). Surely,
He will gather you together on the Day of
Resurrection about which there is no doubt.
And who is truer in statement than Allah?

111 (V.4:86) How the Sal§m (greeting) began.
Narrated Abu Hurairah ~ .ii 1 .r°J: The Prophet ,-1:-J ....i,: .ii 1,)..,, said, "Allah created Adam in
His Image,* sixty cubits (about 30 metres) in height. When He created him, He said (to
him), "Go and greet that group of angels sitting there, and listen what they will say in reply
to you, for that will be your greeting and the greeting of your offspring." Adam (went and)
said, "As-Sa/Smu 'Alaikum (peace be upon you)." They replied, "As-Sa/§mu 'Alaikum wa
Rahmatullah (Peace and AIIAh's Mercy be on you)." So they increased 'wa Rahmatu/lah.' "
The Prophet ,-1-J 4.,iL, .ii 1~ added, "So, whoever will enter Paradise, will be of the shape
and picture of Adam. Since then the creation of Adam's (offspring) (i.e. stature of human
beings) is being diminished continuously up to the present time." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 8,
Hadith No. 246).
*"His Image" means that Adam has been bestowed with life, knowledge, power of hearing,
seeing, understanding, but the features of Adam are different from those of Allah, only the
names are the same, e.g., Allah has life and knowledge and power of understanding, and
Adam also has them, but there is no comparison between the Creator and the created
thing. As Allah says in the Qur'an: "There is nothing like Him, and He is the All-Hearer,
the All-Seer." (V.42:11 ), Allah does not eat or sleep, while Adam used to eat and sleep [for
details See Fath A/-B§ri, Vol. 6, Page 108,9 and Vol.13, Page 238,9].

88. Then what is the matter with you that
you are divided into two parties about the
hypocrites? Allfill has cast them back (to
disbelief) because of what they have earned.
Do you want to guide him whom Allfill has
made to go astray? And he whom Allfill has
made to go astray, you will never find for him
any way ( of guidance).
89. They wish that you reject Faith, as
they have rejected (Faith), and thus that you
all become equal (like one another). So take
not Auliya' (protectors or friends) from them,
till they emigrate in the Way of Allah (to
Muhammad ,1-J <..,iJ,, .ii, _..J.,,). But if they turn
back (from Islam}, talce (hold ot) them and
kill them wherever you find them, and talce
neither Au/iya' (protectors or friends) nor
helpers from them.
90. Except those who Joto a group,
between you and whom there is a treaty (of
peace), or those who approach you with their
breasts restraining from fighting you as well
as fighting their own people. Had Allfill
willed, indeed He would have given them
power over you, and they would have fought
you. So if they withdraw from you, and fight
not against you, and offer you peace, then
Allah has opened no way for you against
them.
91. You will ftnd others that wish to have
security from you and security from their
people. Every time they are sent back to
temptation, they yield thereto. If they
withdraw not from you, nor offer you peace,
nor restrain their hands, take (hold ot) them
and kill them wherever you find them. In their
case, We have provided you with a clear
warrant against them.
92. It is not for a believer to kill a believer
except (that it be} by mistake; and whosoever
kills a believer by mistake, (it is ordained that)
he must set free a believing slave and a
compensation (blood-money, i.e Diya} be
lriven to the deceased's family unless they

remit it. If the deceased belonged to a people at
war with you and he was a believer, the freeing
of a believing slave (is prescribed); and ifhe
belonged to a people with whom you have a
treaty of mutual alliance, compensation
(blood-money - Diya) must be paid to his
family, and a believing slave must be freed.
And whoso finds this (the penance of freeing a
slave) beyond his means, he must fast for two
consecutive months in order to seek repentance
from Allah. And Allah is Ever All-Knowing,
All-Wise.

93. And
whoever
kills a believer
intentionally, his recompense is Hell to abide
therein; and the Wrath and the Curse of Allah
are upon him, and a great punishment is
prepared for him. 111
94. 0 you who believe! When you go (to
fight) in the Cause of Allah, verify (the truth),
and say not to anyone who greets you (by
embracing Islam): "You are not a believer";
seeking the perishable goods of the worldly
life. There are much more profits and booties
with Allah. Even as he is now, so were you
yourselves before till Allah conferred on you
His Favours (i.e. guided you to Islam),
therefore, be cautious in discrimination. Allah
is Ever Well-Aware of what you do.
95. Not equal are those of the believers
who sit (at home), except those who are
disabled (by injury or are blind or lame), and
those who strive hard and fight in the Cause
of Allah with their wealth and their lives.
Allah has preferred in grades those who strive
hard and fight with their wealth and their lives
above those who sit (at home). Unto each,

take (in death) while they are wronging
themselves (as they stayed among the
disbelievers even though emigration was
obligatory for them), they (angels) say (to
them): "In what (condition) were you?" They
reply: "We were weak and oppressed on the
earth." They (angels) say: "Was not the earth
of Allah spacious enough for you to emigrate
therein?" Such men will find their abode in
Hell - What an evil destination! 111
98. Except the weak ones among men,
women and children who cannot devise a
plan, nor are they able to direct their way.
99. These are they whom Allah is likely to
forgive them, and Allah is Ever OftPardoning, Oft-Forgiving.
100. He who emigrates (from his home) in
the Cause of Allah, will find on earth many
dwelling places and plenty to live by. And
whosoever leaves his home as an emigrant
unto Allah and His Messenger, and death
overtakes him, his reward is then surely
incumbent upon Allah. And Allah is Ever
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
101. And when you (Muslims) travel in
the land, there is no sin on you if you shorten
As-Sa/at (the prayer) if you fear that the
disbelievers may put you in trial (attack you

party of them stand up [in Sa/dt (prayer)] with
you taking their arms with them; when they
finish their prostrations, let them take their
positions in the rear and let the other party
come up which have not yet prayed, and let
them pray with you taking all the precautions
and bearing arms. Those who disbelieve wish,
if you were negligent of your arms and your
baggage, to attack you in a single rush, but
there is no sin on you if you put away your
arms because of the inconvenience of rain or
because you are ill, but take every precaution
for yourselves. Verily, Allfill has prepared a
humiliating torment for the disbelievers. 111
103. When you have finished As-Sa/dt
(the congregational prayer), remember Allfill
standing, sitting down, and (lying down) on
your sides, but when you are free from
danger, perform As-Saldt (/qamat-as-Sa/dt).
Verily, As-Sa/dt (the prayer) is enjoined on
the believers at fixed hours.
104. And don't be weak in the pursuit of
the enemy; if you are suffering (hardships)
then surely, they (too) are suffering
(hardships) as you are suffering, but you have
a hope from Allfill (for the reward, i.e.
Paradise) that for which they hope not; and
Allfill is Ever All-Knowing, All-Wise.

Muhammad r-1--, ~.:ii, ir1--) the Book (this
Qur'an) in truth that you might judge between
men by that which Allfill has shown you (i.e.
has taught you through Divine Revelation), so

132. And to Allah belongs all that is in the
heavens and all that is in the earth. And Allah
is Ever All-Sufficient as Disposer of affairs.
133. If He wills, He can talce you away, 0
people, and bring others. And Allah is Ever
All-Potent over that.
134. Whoever desires a reward in this life
of the world, then with Allah (Alone and none
else) is the reward of this worldly life and of
the Hereafter. And Allah is Ever All-Hearer,
All-Seer.
135. 0 you who believe! Stand out firmly
for justice, as witnesses to Allah, even though
it be against yourselves, or your parents, or
your kin, be he rich or poor, Allah is a Better
Protector to both (than you). So follow not
the lusts (of your hearts), lest you avoid
justice; and if you distort your witness or
refuse to give it, verily, Allah is Ever
Well-Acquainted with what you do. 111
136. 0 you who believe! Believe in Allah,
and His Messenger (Muhammad ~ .ii, ._,.J...
f-J), and the Book (the Qur'an) which He has
sent down to His Messenger, and the
Scripture which He sent down to those before
(him); and whosoever disbelieves in Allah,
His Angels, His Books, His Messengers, and
the Last Day, then indeed he has strayed far
away.
137. Verily, those who believe, then
disbelieve, then believe (again), and (again)
disbelieve, and go on increasing in disbelief;

111 (V.4:135) Narrated Anas ~.Ji,~;: The Prophet r!--J ~ .ii 1.,i... was asked about the
great sins. He said, "They are:
a) To join others in worship with Allah.
b) To be undutiful to one's parents.
c) To kill a person (which Allah has forbidden to be killed i.e.to commit the crime of
murdering).
d) And to give a false witness.·

Io '";:-,

Allah will not forgive them, nor guide them
on the (Rigbt) Way.

138. Give to the hypocrites the tidings
that there is for them a painful torment. !tl
139. Those who take disbelievers for
Auliyii' (protectors or helpers or friends)
instead of believers, do they seek honour,
power and glory with them? Verily, then
to Allah belongs all honour, power and
glory.
140. And it has already been revealed
to you in the Book (this Qur'an) that
when you hear the Verses of Allah being
denied and mocked at, then sit not with
them, until they engage in a talk other
than that; (but if you stayed with them)
certainly in that case you would be like
them. Surely, Allah will collect the
hypocrites and disbelievers all together in
Hell.
141. Those (hyprocrites) who wait and
watch about you; if you gain a victory
from Allah, they say: "Were we not with
you?" But if the disbelievers gain a
success, they say (to them): "Did we not
gain mastery over you and did we not
protect you from the believers?" Allah
will judge between you (all) on the Day of
Resurrection. And never will Allah grant
to the disbelievers a way (to triumph)
over the believers.
142. Verily, the hypocrites seek to
deceive Allah, but it is He Who deceives
them. 121 And when they stand up for AsSa/iit (the prayer), they stand with
laziness and to be seen of men, and they
do not remember Allah but little.

143. (They are) swaying between this
and that, belonging neither to these nor to
those; and he whom Allih sends astray,
you will not find for him a way (to the
truth - Islam).
144. 0 you who believe! Take not for
Auliya' (protectors or helpers or friends)
disbelievers instead of believers. Do you
wish to offer Allah a manifest proof
against yourselves?
145. Verily, the hyprocrites will be in
the lowest depth (grade) of the Fire; no
helper will you find for them. 111
146. Except those who repent (from
hypocrisy), do righteous good deeds, hold
fast to Allah, and purify their religion for
Allih (by worshipping none but Allah,
and do good for Allah's sake only, not to
show off), then they will be with the
believers. And Allih will grant the
believers a great reward.
147. Why should AlUih punish you if
you have thanked (Him) and have
believed in Him. And Allah is Ever
All-Appreciative (of good), All-Knowing.

111 (V.4:145):
a) Narrated 'AbdullAh bin 'Amr ~ .ii 1 ~J: The Prophet r1-, ~ .ii 1 ...,i... said:
"Whoever has the following four (characteristics) will be a pure hypocrite and whoever
has one of the following four characteristics will have one characteristic of hypocrisy
unless and until he gives it up:
1. Whenever he is entrusted, he betrays (proves dishonest).
2. Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.
3. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves treacherous.
4. Whenever he quarrels, he behaves in a very imprudent, evil and insulting manner.•
(Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, Hadith No. 33).
b) See the footnote of (V.9:54).
c) Narrated Abu Hurairah ~ .ii, ~J: The Prophet ,i-, ~ .ii 1 ~ said, "The worst
people before AIIAh on the Day of Resurrection will be the double-faced people who
appear to some people with one face and to other people with another face." (Sahih
Al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Hadith No. 84).

148. Allah does not like that the evil
should be uttered in public except by him
who has been wronged. And Allah is Ever
All-Hearer, All-Knower.
149. Whether you (mankind) disclose (by
good words of thanks) a good deed (done to
you in the form of a favour by someone), or
conceal it, or pardon an evil, ... verily, Allah is
Ever Oft-Pardoning, All-Powerful.
150. Verily, those who disbelieve in Allah
and His Messengers and wish to make
distinction
between Allah
and His
Messengers (by believing in Allah and
disbelieving in His Messengers) saying, "We
believe in some but reject others," and wish
to adopt a way in between.
151. They are in truth disbelievers. And
We have prepared for the disbelievers a
humiliating torment.
152. And those who believe in Allah
and His Messengers and make no
distinction
between any of them
(Messengers), We shall give them their
rewards; and Allah is Ever Oft-Forgiving,
Most Merciful.
153. The people of the Scripture (Jews)
ask you to cause a book to descend upon
them from heaven. Indeed they asked Musa
(Moses) for even greater than that, when they
said: "Show us Allah in public," but they
were struck with thunderclap and lightning
for their wickedness. Then they worshipped
the calf even after clear proofs, evidences,
and signs had come to them. (Even) so We
forgave them. And We gave Musa (Moses) a
clear proof of authority.
154. And for their covenant, We raised
over them the Mount and (on the other
occasion) We said: "Enter the gate prostrating
(or bowing) with humility;" and We
commanded them: "Transgress not (by doing

worldly works) on the Sabbath (Saturdart/'"
And We took from them a firm covenant 1 •
1SS. Because of their breaking the
covenant, and of their rejecting the Ayat ·
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.) of Allfilt, and of their
killing the Prophets unjustly, and oftheir
saying: "Our hearts are wrapped (with
coverings, i.e. we do not understand what
the Messengers say)" - nay, Allfill has set a
seal upon their hearts because of their
disbelief, so they believe not but a little.
1S6. And
because of their (Jews)
disbelief and uttering against Maryam (Mary
r:iw' ~) a grave false charge (that she has
committed illegal sexual intercourse);
1S7. And because of their saying (in
boast), "We killed Messiah 'Isa (Jesus), son
of Maryam (Mary), the Messenger of
Allfill," - but they killed him not, nor
crucified him, but the resemblance of 'Isa
(Jesus) was put over another man (and they
killed that man), and those who differ
therein are full of doubts. They have no
(certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but
conjecture. For surely; they killed him not
[i.e. 'Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)
r'.)l..JI

l..+.!J,,]:

1S8. But Allah raised him ['Isa (Jesus)]
up (with his body and soul) unto Himself
(and he r:iw1 ~ is in the heavens). And
Allfill is Ever All-Powerful, All-Wise.
1S9. And there is none of the people of
the Scripture (Jews and Christians) but must
believe in him ['Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam
111 ,Y. 4:154) Narrated Abu Hurairah ...., ,jJ 1.r/ AIIAh's Messenger ,-l-J ..,is ,jJ 1 ._;..,, said, "It
was said to Bani Israel, 'Enter the gate (of the town) bowing with humility (prostrating
yourselves) and say: 'Repentance', but they changed the word and entered the town
crawling on their buttocks and said: 'A wheat grain in the hair'*." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4,
Hadith No. 615).
*They said so just to ridicule AIIAh's Order as they were disobedient to Him. So AIIAh
punished them severely by sending on them punishment, most probably in the form of (an
epidemic of) plague (See Tafsir At-Taban).

['Isa (Jesus)] will be a witness against them.
160. For the wrong-doing of the Jews,
We made unlawful for them certain good
foods which had been lawful for them and for their hindering many from Allah's
Way;

121 (V.4:159) - "Before his death," has two interpretations: before Jesus' death after his
descent from the heavens, or a Jew's or a Christian's death, at the time of the appearance
of the Angel of Death when he will realize that 'lsa (Jesus) was only a Messenger of Allah,
and had no share in Divinity.
13.1 (V.4: 163) Ash-Shaikh Al-Imam Al-Hafiz Abu 'Abdullah Muhammad bin lsma'il bin Ibrahim

"The reward of deeds depends upon the intentions and every person will get the reward
according to what he has intended. So whoever emigrates for worldly benefits or for a

165. Messengers as bearers of good news
as well as of warning in order that mankind

166. But Alliih bears witness to that
which He has sent down (the Qur'an) unto

171. 0
people of the Scripture
(Christians)! Do not exceed the limits in
your religion, nor say of Allah aught but the
truth. The Messiah 'Isa (Jesus), son of
Maryam (Mary), was (no more than) a
Messenger of Allah and His Word, ("Be!"
- and he was) which He bestowed on
Maryam (Mary) and a spirit (Riih) 121 created
by Him; so believe in Allah and His
Messengers. Say not: "Three (trinity)!"
Cease! (it is) better for you. For Allah is (the
only) One I/ah (God), glory be to Him (Far
Exalted is He) above having a son. To Him
belongs all that is in the heavens and all that
is in the earth. And Allah is All-Sufficient as
a Disposer of affairs. 131
111 (V.4:169) See the footnote of 0,1. 3:85).
121 0,1.4:171) ROh-u/1/Jh: According to the early religious scholars from among the
Companions of the Prophet r-1--J ~ ..:U1 .;.. and their students and the MujtahidOn, there is a
rule to distinguish between the two nouns in the genitive construction:
a) When one of the two nouns is Allah, and the other is a person or a thing, e.g. Allah's
House (Bait-ull/Jh); Allah's Messenger (RasOl-u/1/Jh); Allah's slave ('Abdullah); Allah's spirit
(ROh-ullah), the rule for the above words is that the second noun, e.g., house, messenger,
slave, spirit is created by Allah and is honourable in His Sight, and similarly, Allah's spirit
may be understood as the spirit of Allah, in fact it is a soul created by Allah, i.e. 'isa
(Jesus). And it was His Word: "Be!" -and he was.[i.e. 'lsa (Jesus) was created like Adam].
b) But when one of the two is Allah and the second is neither a person nor a thing, then it is
not a created thing but is a quality of Allah e.g. Allah's Knowledge ('llm-ullah); Allah's Life
wayat-ullah); Allah's Statement (Kalam-ul/ah); Allah's Self (Dhat-ullah).
1 0,1.4:171) Narrated 'Ubadah ....., . .u1 ~;: The Prophet r!--J ....,J.&. . .u1 ,,..J.., said, "If anyone
testifies that La ilaha illa/1/Jh (none has the right to be worshipped but ATiah Alone) Who has
no partners, and that Muhammad rl:-J ~ ...u1.;.. is His slave and His Messenger, and that
Jesus r::.L.J1 ....,J.&. is Allah's slave and His Messenger and His Word ("Be!" - and he was)
which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit (Ruh) created by Him, and that Paradise is the
truth, and Hell is the truth - Allah will admit him into Paradise with the deeds which he had
done even if those deeds were few." (Junadah, the subnarrator said, "'Ubadah added:

172. The Messiah will never be proud to
reject to be a slave of Allah, nor the angels
who are the near (to Allah). And whosoever
rejects His worship and is proud, then He
will gather them all together unto Himself.
173. So, as for those who believed (in
the Oneness of Allah
Islamic
Monotheism)
and
did
deeds
of
righteousness, He will give them their (due)
rewards - and more out of His Bounty. But
as for those who refused His worship and
were proud, He will punish them with a
painful torment . And they will not find for
themselves besides Allah any protector or
helper.
174. 0 mankind! Verily, there has come
to you a convincing proof (Prophet
Muhammad ,.i-, ~.:ii, _,i...) from your Lord;
and We sent down to you a manifest light
(this Qur'!n).
175. So, as for those who believed in
Allah and held fast to Him, He will admit
them to His Mercy and Grace (i.e. Paradise),
and guide them to Himself by the Straight
Path
176. They ask you for a legal verdict.
Say: "Allah directs (thus) about Al-Kaid/ah
(those who leave neither descendants nor
ascendants as heirs). If it is a man that dies
leaving a sister, but no child, she shall have
half the inheritance. If (such a deceased
was) a woman, who left no child, her brother
takes her inheritance. If there are two sisters,
they shall have two-thirds of the inheritance;
if there are brothers and sisters, the male
will have twice the share of the female.
{Thus) does Allah make clear to you
(His Law) lest you go astray. And
Allah is the All-Knower of everything."

'Such a person can enter Paradise through any of its eight gates he likes.'") (Sahih AIBukMri, Vol. 4, Hadith No. 644).

"Lawful unto you are At-Tayyibdt [all kinds

made lawful (meat of slaughtered eatable
animals, milk products, fats, vegetables and
fruits)]. And those beasts and birds of prey
which you have trained as hounds, training
and teaching them (to catch) in the manner as
directed to you by Allah; so eat of what they

At-Tayyibdt [all kinds of Haiti/ (lawful)

foods, which Allah has made lawful (meat of

(slaughtered cattle, eatable animals) of the

in legal wedlock) not committing illegal
sexual intercourse, nor taking them as girlfriends. And whosoever disbelieves in Faith
[i.e. in the Oneness of Allah and in all the
other Articles of Faith i.e. His (Allah's)
Angels, His Holy Books, His Messengers, the
Day of Resurrection and Al-Qadar (Divine
Preordainments)], then fruitless is his work;

offer As-Safrit (the prayer), wash your faces
and your hands (forearms) up to the elbows,
rub (by passing wet hands over) your heads,
and (wash) your feet up to the ankles 111 • If you
are in a state of Jandba (i.e. after a sexual
discharge), purify yourselves (bathe your

journey, or any of you comes after answering
the call of nature, or you have been in contact

enmity and hatred of others make you avoid
justice. Be just: that is nearer to piety; and
fear Allah. Verily, Allah is Well-Acquainted

9. Allah has promised those who believe
(in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic
Monotheism) and do deeds of righteousness,
that for them there is forgiveness and a great
reward (i.e. Paradise).
10. And those who disbelieve and deny

Favour of Allah unto you when some people

12. Indeed Allah took the covenant from
the Children of Israel (Jews), and We
appointed twelve leaders among them. And
Allah said: "I am with you if you perform AsSalat (Jqamat-as-Salat) and give Zakat and
believe in My Messengers; honour and assist
them, and lend a good loan to Allah, verily, I
will expiate your sins and admit you to
Gardens under which rivers flow (in
Paradise). But if any of you after this,

the Straight Path."

Verily, Allah loves AI-Muhsimin (good-doers

14. And from those who call themselves

Allah's disobedience); and Allah will inform
them of what they used to do.

30. So the Nafs (self) of the other (latter
one) encouraged him and made fair-seeming
to him the murder of his brother; he murdered
him and became one of the losers.
31. Then Allah sent a crow who scratched
the ground to show him to hide the dead body
of his brother. He (the murderer) said: "Woe
to me! Am I not even able to be as this crow
and to hide the dead body of my brother?"
Then he became one of those who regretted.
32. Because of that We ordained for the
Children of Israel that if anyone killed a
person not in retaliation of murder, or (and)
to spread mischief in the land - it would be
as if he killed all mankind, and if anyone
saved a life, it would be as if he saved the life
of all mankind. And indeed, there came to
them Our Messengers with clear proofs,

many of them continued to exceed the limits
(e.g. by doing oppression unjustly and
exceeding beyond the limits set by Allah by
committing the major sins) in the land! 111

forgives whom He wills. And Allah is Able to
do all things.

41. 0 Messenger (Muhammad ..,i.. .ii 1.)-,,
rL,,J)! Let not those who hurry to fall into
disbelief grieve you, of such who say: "We
believe" with their mouths but their hearts
have no faith. And of the Jews are men who
listen much and eagerly to lies - listen to
others who have not come to you. They
change the words from their places; they say,
"If you are given this, take it, but if you are
not given this, then
beware!" And
whomsoever Allah wants to put in AI-Fitnah
[error, because of his rejecting of Faith], you
can do nothing for him against Allah. Those
are the ones whose hearts Allah does not want
to purify (from disbelief and hypocrisy); for
them there is a disgrace in this world, and in
the Hereafter a great torment.
42. (They like to) listen to falsehood, to
devour anything forbidden. So if they come to
you (0 Muhammad ri-'J 4ls .ii 1 ~ ) , either
judge between them, or turn away from them.
If you turn away from them, they cannot hurt
you in the least. And if you judge, judge with
justice between them. Verily, Allah loves
those who act justly.
43. But how do they come to you for
decision while they have the Taurat (Torah), in
which is the (plain) Decision of Allah; yet even
after that, they tum away. For they are not
(really) believers.

44. Verily, We did send down the Taurat
(Torah) [to Musa (Moses)], therein was
guidance and light, by which the Prophets,
who submitted themselves to Allah's Will,
judged for the Jews. And the rabbis and the
priests [too judged for the Jews by the Taurat
{Torah) after those Prophets], for to them was
entrusted the protection of Allah's Book, and
they were witnesses thereto. Therefore fear
not men but fear Me (0 Jews) and sell not My
Verses for a miserable price. And whosoever
does not judge by what Allah has revealed,
such are the Ktifirun (i.e. disbelievers - of a

Laws). 111

45. And We ordained therein for them:
"Life for life, 121 eye for eye, nose for nose, ear
for ear, tooth for tooth, and wounds equal for
equal." But if anyone remits the retaliation by
way of charity, it shall be for him an
expiation. And whosoever does not judge by
that which Allah has revealed, such are the
Ziilimun (polytheists and wrong-doers - of a
lesser degree).
46. And in their footsteps, We sent 'Isa
(Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary), 131 confirming
the Taurat (Torah) that had come before him,
and We gave him the lnjeel (Gospel), in
which was guidance and light and
confirmation of the Taurat (Torah) that had
come before it, a guidance and an admonition
for AI-Muttaqun (the pious - See V.2:2).

one nation, but that (He) may test you in what
He has given you; so compete in good deeds.
The return of you (all) is to Allah; then He
will inform you about that in which you used

beware of them lest they turn you (0

Allah's Will is to punish them for some sins
of theirs. And truly, most of men are Fasiqun

evil doer, in the Haram (sanctuaries of Makkah and AI-Madinah); (2) a person who wants
that the traditions of the pre-Islamic period of Ignorance should remain in Islam; and (3) a
person who seeks to shed somebody's blood without any right." (Sahih Af-BukhlJri, Vol. 9. Hadith No.

And Allah does not like the Mufsidun
(mischief-makers).
6S. And ifonly the people of the Scripture
(Jews and Christians) had believed (in
Muhammad r-'J ~ .Ji 1 _,J..,) and warded off
evil (sin, ascribing partners to Allfilt) and had
become Al-Muttaqun (the pious See
V.2:2) We would indeed have expiated from
them their sins and admitted them to Gardens
of pleasure (in Paradise).
66. And if only they had acted according
to the Taurftt (Torah), the Injeel (Gospel), and
what has (now) been sent down to them from
their Lord (the Qur'ful), they would surely
have gotten provision from above them and
from underneath their feet. There are from
among them people who are on the right
course (i.e. they act on the revelation and
believe in Prophet Muhammad r-1--J ~ .Ji I Jas 'Abdullah bin Salam.111 ~ .:u 1 .ri';), but
many of them do evil deeds.

111 (V.5:66) Narrated Anas ....., .Ji 1 ~ ; : When the news of the arrival of the Prophet .Ji 1 ._;.,,
rl--J ...,is, at AI-Madinah reached 'Abdullah bin Salam, he went to him (i.e. the Prophet .:u 1._;.,,
r-1:--J ....,.is) to ask him about certain things. He said, "I am going to ask you about three things
which only a Prophet can answer: What is the first sign of The Hour? What is the first food
which the people of Paradise will eat? Why does a child attract the similarity to his father or
to his mother?" the Prophet ,.S...J ...is .:u I J- replied, "Jibrael (Gabriel) has just now informed
me of that." lbn Salam said, "He [i.e. Jibrael (Gabriel)] is the enemy of the Jews from
amongst the angels." The Prophet rl:'J ...is .:u I J- said, "As for the first sign of The Hour, it
will be a fire that will collect (or gather) the people from the east to the west. As for the first
meal which the people of Paradise will eat, it will be the caudate (extra) lobe of the fishliver. As for the child, if the man's discharge precedes the woman's discharge, the child
attracts the similarity to the man, and if the woman's discharge precedes the man's, then
the child attracts the similarity to the woman." On this, 'Abdullah bin Salam said, "I testify
that L§ il§ha il/all§h (none has the right to be worshipped but Allah) and that you are the
Messenger of Allah", and added, "O AIIAh's Messenger! Jews make such lies as make one
astonished, so please ask them about me before they know about my conversion to lslAm."
The Jews came and the Prophet ,.S...J ...is .ii 1._;.,,_ said, "What kind of man is 'Abdullah bin

most superior among us, and the son of the most superior among us." The Prophet .Ji 1 ._;.,,

said, "May Allah protect him from that.· The Prophet r1-J ...is .:u 1._;.,, repeated his question

sent down to you from your Lord. And if you
do not, then you have not conveyed His
Message. Allah will protect you from
mankind. Verily, Allah guides not the people

68. Say (0 Muhammad r!-J ~ .:ii 1 ~ ) "O

You have nothing (as regards guidance) till
you act according to the Taurat (Torah), the

Verily, that which has been sent down to you
(Muhammad rl-J ~ .:ii 1.,.i..) from your Lord
increases in most of them (their) obstinate
rebellion and disbelief. So be not sorrowful
over the people who disbelieve.
69. Surely, those who believe (in the
Oneness of Allah, in His Messenger
Muhammad rl-J ~ .:ii 1.,.i.. and all that was
revealed to him from Allah), and those who
are the Jews and the Sabians and the
Christians, - whosoever believed in Allah
and the Last Day, and worked righteousness,
on them shall be no fear, nor shall they
grieve.111

70. Verily, We took the covenant of the
Children of Israel and sent Messengers to
them. Whenever there came to them a
Messenger with what they themselves desired
not, - a group of them they called liars, and
others among them they killed.
71. They thought there will be no Fitnah

(i.e.'AbdullAh bin SalAm) said, "It is this that I was afraid of, 0 AIIAh's Messenger." (Sahih
AI-Bukhlri, Vol.5, HadTth No.275).
111 (V.5:69) This verse (V. 5:69) and (Verse 2:62) should not be misinterpreted by the reader
as mentioned by lbn 'AbbAs (Tafsir At-Tabari ) that the provision of this Verse was
abrogated by the (V. 3:85). And after the coming of Prophet Muhammad ,.i.., ~ .:iJ 1 ._;.... no

blind and deaf. And Allah is the All-Seer of

72. Surely, they have disbelieved who say:
"Allah is the Messiah ['Isa (Jesus)], son of
Maryam (Mary)." But the Messiah ['isa
(Jesus)] said: "O Children oflsrael! Worship
Allah, my Lord and your Lord." Verily,
whosoever sets up partners (in worship) with
Allah, then Allah has forbidden Paradise to
him, and the Fire will be his abode111 • And for
the Zdlimun (polytheists and wrong-doers)
there are no helpers.

said: "Allah is the third of the three (in a
Trinity)." But there is no Ildh (god) (none
who has the right to be worshipped) but One

78. Those among the Children oflsrael 111

who disbelieved were cursed by the tongue of
111 (V.5:78). The tale of a leper, a bald man and a blind man:
Narrated Abu Hurairah ~ .ii 1 ._,..;,1 that he heard Allah's Messenger r.1--J <,iJ.; .:u 1 ..,.i-, saying,
"Allah willed to test three Israelis who were a leper, a blind man and a bald headed man.
So, He sent them an angel who came to the leper and said, 'What thing do you like most?'
He replied, 'Good colour and good skin, for the people have a strong aversion to me.' The
angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given a good colour and beautiful
skin. The angel asked him, 'What kind of property do you like best?' He replied, 'Camels.'
So he (i.e., the leper) was given a pregnant she-camel, and the angel said (to him), 'May
Allah bless you in it.' The angel then went to the bald-headed man and said, 'What thing do
you like most?' He said, 'I like good hair and wish to be cured of this disease, for the people
feel repulsion for me.' The angel touched him and his illness was cured, and he was given
good hair. The angel asked (him), 'What kind of property do you like best?' He replied
'Cows.' The angel gave him a pregnant cow and said, 'May Allah bless in it.' The angel
went to the blind man and asked, 'What thing do you like best?' He said, '(I like) that Allah
may restore my eyesight to me so that I may see the people.' The angel touched his eyes
and Allah gave him back his eyesight. The angel asked him, 'What kind of property do you
like best?' He replied, 'Sheep.' The angel gave him a pregnant sheep. Afterwards, all the
three pregnant animals gave birth to young ones, and multiplied and brought forth so much
that one of the (three) men had a herd of camels filling a valley, and one had a herd of
cows filling a valley, and one had a flock of sheep filling a valley. Then the angel, disguised
in the shape and appearance of a leper, went to the leper and said, 'I am a poor man, who
has lost all means of livelihood while on a journey. So none will satisfy my need except
Allah and then you. In the Name of Him Who has given you such nice colour and beautiful
skin, and so much-'property, I ask you to give me a camel so that I may reach my
destination.' The man replied, 'I have many obligations (so I cannot give you).' The angel
said, 'I think I know you. Were you not a leper to whom the people had a strong aversion?
Weren't you a poor man, and then Allah gave you (all this property).' He replied, '(This is all
wrong), I got this property through inheritance from my forefathers.' The angel said, 'If you
are telling a lie then let Allah make you as you were before.' Then the angel, disguised in
the shape and appearance of a bald man, went to the bald man and said to him the same
as he told the first one, and he too answered the same as the first one did. The angel said,
'If you are telling a lie, then let Allah make you as you were before.' The angel, disguised in
the shape of a blind man, went to the blind man and said, 'I am a poor man and a traveller,
whose means of livelihood have been exhausted while on a journey. I have nobody to help

Maryam (Mary). That was because they
disobeyed (Allah and the Messengers) and
were ever transgressing beyond bounds.
79. They used not to forbid one another
from Al-Munkar (wrong, evil-doing, sins,
polytheism, disbelief) which they committed.
Vile indeed was what they used to do.
80. You see many of them taking the
disbelievers as their Auliya' (protectors and
helpers). Evil indeed is that which their
ownselves have sent forward before them; for
that (reason) Allah's Wrath fell upon them,
and in torment they will abide.

81. And had they believed in Allah, and in
the Prophet (Muhammad f""J ~ .:ii 1.;..) and in
what has been revealed to him, never would
they have taken them (the disbelievers) as
Auliya' (protectors and helpers); but many of
them are the Fasiqun (rebellious, disobedient
to Allah).
82. Verily, you will find the strongest
among men in enmity to the believers
(Muslims) the Jews and those who are AlMushrikun, 111 and you will find the nearest in
love to the believers (Muslims) those who
say: "We are Christians." That is because

you back your eyesight to give me a sheep, so that with its help, I may complete my
journey.' The man said, 'No doubt, I was blind and Allah gave me back my eyesight; I was
poor and Allah made me rich; so take anything you wish from my property. By Allah, I will
not stop you for taking anything (you need) of my property which you may take for Allah's
sake.' The angel replied, 'Keep your property with you. You (i.e., three men) have been
tested and Allah is pleased with you and is angry with your two companions.'" (Sahih A/Bukh!Jri, Vol. 4, Hadith No. 670).

83. And when they (who call themselves
Christians) listen to what has been sent down
to the Messenger {Muhammad r-'' . .,_. .:ii 1.)-),
you see their eyes overflowmg with tears
because of the truth they have recognised.
They say: "Our Lord! We believe; so write us
down among the witnesses.
84. "And why should we not believe in
Allah and in that which has come to us of the

that our Lord will admit us (in Paradise on the
Day of Resurrection) along with the righteous
people (Prophet Muhammad ,.i.-, ~ .:ii 1 _,..i..,
and his Companions ~.:ii, ,_,;,)."
85. So because of what they said, Allah
rewarded them Gardens under which rivers
flow (in Paradise), they will abide therein
forever. Such is the reward of Al-Muhsinun
(the good-doers).

86. But those who disbelieved and belied
Our Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons,
signs, revelations, etc.), they shall be the
dwellers of the (Hell) Fire.
87. 0 you who believe! Make not
unlawful the Tayyibdt (all that is good as
regards foods, things, deeds, beliefs, persons)
which Allah has made lawful to you, and
transgress not. Verily, Allah does not like the
transgressors.
88. And eat of the things which Allah has
provided for you, lawful and good, and fear
Allah in Whom you believe.

89. Allah will not punish you for
what is unintentional in your oaths, but He
will punish you for your deliberate oaths; for
its expiation feed ten Masdkin (poor
persons), on a scale of the average of that
with which you feed your own families, or
clothe them or manumit a slave. But
whosoever cannot afford (that), then he
should fast for three days. That is the

121 (V.5:89) It is better not to take oaths, but if you have taken it, and later you find a
better solution for the problem, then act according to the better one and give expiation

AIIAh's Name has been mentioned on slaughtering." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.7, Had1th

sheep and ask them for something, but they will say to him, 'Return to us tomorrow.'
Allah will destroy them during the night and will let the mountain fall on them, and He will

questions, then on that account they became
disbelievers.
103. Allfill has not instituted thin~ like
Bahirah111 , or Sd 'ibah 121 , or Wasilahi. 1, or
Ham 141 , (all these animals were liberated in

honour of idols as practised by pagan Arabs
in the pre-Islamic period).
But those who
disbelieve invent lies against Allfill, and most
of them have no understanding.
104. And when it is said to them: "Come
to what Allfill has revealed and unto the
Messenger (Muhammad ,.i-J ~ .:ii 1 ~ for the
verdict of that which you have made
unlawful)." They say: "Enough for us is that
which we found our fathers following," even
though their fathers had no knowledge
whatsoever nor guidance.
105. 0 you who believe! Take care of
your ownselves 151 • If you follow the (right)
guidance [and enjoin what is right (Islamic
Monotheism and all that Islam orders one to
do) and forbid what is wrong (polytheism,
disbelief and all that Islam has forbidden)] no
hurt can come to you from those who are in
error. The return of you all is to Allfill, then
He will inform you about (all) that which you
used to do.

111 (V.5:103) Bah1rah: a she-camel whose milk was spared for the sake of the idols and
nobody was allowed to milk it.
l2l (V.5:103) Sa'ibah: a she-camel let loose for free pasture for their false gods, e.g. idols
and nothing was allowed to be carried on it.
C3l (V.5:103) Wasilah: a she-camel set free for idols because it has given birth to a
she-camel at its first delivery and second delivery.
14.1 (V.5: 103) Ham: a stallion-camel freed from work for the sake of their idols, after it had
finished a number of copulations assigned for it.
151 (V 5:105) Take care of yourselves i.e. do righteous deeds, fear Allah much (abstain from
all kinds of sins and evil deeds which He has forbidden) and love Allah much (perform all
kinds of good deeds which He has ordained).

106. 0 you who believe! When death
approaches any of you, and you make a
bequest, (then take) the testimony of two just
men of your own folk or two others from
outside, while you are travelling through the
land and death befalls on you. Detain them
both after As-Sa/at (the prayer), (then) if you
are in doubt (about their truthfulness), let
them both swear by Allah (saying): "We wish
not for any worldly gain in this, even though
he (the beneficiary) be our near relative. We
shall not hide Testimony of Allah, for then
indeed we should be of the sinful."

107. If then it gets known that these two
had been guilty of sin, let two others stand
forth in their places, nearest in kin from
among those who claim a lawful right. Let
them swear by Allah (saying): "We affirm
that our testimony is truer than that of both of
them, and that we have not trespassed (the
truth), for then indeed we should be of the
wrong-doers."

108. That should make it closer (to the
fact) that their testimony would be in its true
shape (and thus accepted), or else they would
fear that (other) oaths would be admitted after
their oaths. And fear Allah and listen (with

In the Name ofAllah
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

1. All praises and thanks be to Allah,
Who (Alone) created the heavens and the
earth, and originated the darkness and the
light; yet those who disbelieve hold others
as equal with their Lord.

2. He it is Who has created you from
clay, and then has decreed a (stated) term
(for you to die). And there is with Him
another determined term (for you to be
resurrected),
yet you doubt (in the
Resurrection).
3. And He is Allah (to be worshipped
Alone) in the heavens and on the earth; He
knows what you conceal and what you
reveal, and He knows what you earn (good
or bad). (See V.43:84)
4. And never an Ayah (sign) comes to
them from the Aydt (proofs, evidences,
verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of
their Lord, but that they have been turning
away from it.
5. Indeed, they rejected the truth (the
Qur'An and Muhammad r-1--, ~ .:ii 1 ..,.i..,)111
when it came to them, but there will come to
them the news of that (the torment) which
they used to mock at.

them. Yet We destroyed them for their sins,
and We created after
them other
generations.
7. And even if We had sent down unto
you (0 Muhammad r-J---, ~ iii,~) a
Message written on paper so that they could
touch it with their hands, the disbelievers
would have said: "This is nothing but
obvious magic!"

8. And they say: "Why has not an angel
been sent down to him?" Had We sent down
an angel, the matter would have been judged
at once, and no respite would be granted to
them.
9. And had We appointed him an angel,
We indeed would have made him a man, and
We would have certainly confused them in
which they are already confused (i.e. the
Message of Prophet Muhammad ~ iii , ~

r1--,).
10. And indeed (many) Messengers
before you were mocked at, but their
scoffers were surrounded by the very thing
that they used to mock at.
11. Say (0 Muhammad r,l--J <.!ls iii 1 ~ ) :
"Travel in the land and see what was the end
of those who rejected truth."

"To whom belongs all that is in the heavens

Those who have lost themselves will not
believe [in Allah as being the only I/ah
(God), and Muhammad ,.i-, ._.i. ..:ii 1 .,.i.., as
being one of His Messengers, and in
Resurrection].
13. And to Him belongs whatsoever
exists in the night and the day, and He is the
All-Hearing, the All-Knowing."
14. Say (0 Muhammad ,.i-, <l,!ls .JJ1 _;...):
"Shall I take as a Wali (Helper, Protector,
Lord or God) any other than Allah, the
Creator of the heavens and the earth? And it
is He Who feeds but is not fed." Say:
"Verily, I am commanded to be the first of
those who submit themselves to Allah (as
Muslims)." And be not you (0 Muhammad
,.;-J <l,!ls ..:ii 1 _;...) of the Mushrikun [polytheists,
pagans, idolaters and disbelievers in the
Oneness of Allah]. (Tafsir AI-Qurtubi)

15. Say: "I fear, if I disobey my Lord,
the torment of a Mighty Day."
16. He who is averted from (such a
torment) on that Day, (Allah) has surely
been Merciful to him. And that would be the
obvious success.

17. And if Allah touches you with harm,
none can remove it but He, and if He
touches you with good, then He is Able to
do all things.
18. And He is the lrresistible,(Supreme)
above His slaves, and He is the All-Wise,
Well-Acquainted with all things.
19. Say (0 Muhammad ,.i-, <l,!ls ..:ii 1 .;,..):
"What thing is the most great in witness?"
Say: "Allah (the Most Great!) is Witness
between me and you; this Qur'iin has been
revealed to me that I may therewith warn
you and whomsoever it may reach. Can you
verily bear witness that besides Allah there

I am innocent of what you join in worship

20. Those to whom We have given the

21. And who does more aggression and
wrong than he who invents a lie against
Allah or rejects His Aydt (proofs, evidences,
verses, lessons or revelations)? Verily, the
Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers) shall
never be successful.

22. And on the Day when We shall
gather them all together, then We shall say
to those who joined partners (in worship
with Us): "Where are your partners (false
deities) whom you used to assert (as partners
in worship with Allah)?"
23. There will then be (left) no Fitnah

them but to say: "By Allah, our Lord, we
were not those who joined others in worship

"Tell me if Allah's Torment comes upon
you, or the Hour comes upon you, would
you then call upon any one other than Allah?

41. Nay! To Him Alone you would call,
and, if He wills, He would remove that
(distress) for which you call upon Him, and
you would forget at that time whatever
partners you joined (with Him in worship)!

42. Verily, We sent (Messengers) to
many nations before you (0 Muhammad
rL--J ~ ..ii 1 ~ ). And We seized them with
extreme poverty (or loss in wealth) and loss
in health (with calamities) so that they might
humble themselves (believe with humility).
43. When Our Torment reached them,
why then did they not humble themselves
(believe with humility)? But their hearts
became hardened, and Shaitan (Satan) made
fair- seeming to them that which they used
to do.
44. So, when they forgot (the warning)
with which they had been reminded, We
opened for them the gates of every

and lo! They were plunged into destruction
with deep regrets and sorrows.
45. So the root of the people who did
wrong was cut off. And all the praises and
thanks are to Allah, the Lord of the 'Alamin
(mankind, jinn, and all that exists).
46. Say (to the disbelievers): "Tell me, if
Allah took away your hearing and your
sight, and sealed up your hearts, who is
there - an ildh (a god) other than AWih
who could restore them to you?" See how
variously We explain the Aydt (proofs,

Allah comes to you suddenly (during the
night), or openly (during the day), will any
be destroyed except the Zdlimun (polytheists

48 And We send not the Messengers but
as givers of glad tidings and as wamers. So
whosoever believes and does righteous good
deeds, upon such shall come no fear, nor
shall they grieve.
49. But those who reject Our Aydt

nothing, that you may tum them away, and
thus become of the Zdlimiin (unjust).
53. Thus We have tried some of them
with others, that they might say: "Is it these
(poor believers) whom Allah has favoured
from amongst us?" Does not Allah know
best those who are grateful?
54. When those who believe in Our Aydt
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.) come to you, say:
"Sa/dmun 'A/aikum" (peace be on you);
your Lord has written (prescribed) Mercy
for Himself, so that if any of you does evil
in ignorance, and thereafter repents and does
righteous good deeds (by obeying Allah),
then surely, He is Oft-Forgiving, Most
Merciful.

55. And thus do We explain the Aydt
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.) in detail, that the way of
the Mujrimiin (criminals, polytheists,
sinners) may become manifest.

them till they tum to another topic. And if
Shaitan (Satan) causes you to forget, then
after the remembrance sit not you in the
company of those people who are the
Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers).
69. Those who fear Allah, keep their
duty to Him and avoid evil are not
responsible for them (the disbelievers) in
any case, but (their duty) is to remind them,
that they may fear Allah (and refrain from
mocking at the Qur'an). [The provision of
this Verse was abrogated by the Verse
4: 140].

religion as play and amusement, and whom
the life of this world has deceived. But
remind (them) with it (the Qur'an) lest a
person be given up to destruction for that
which he has earned, when he will find for
himself no protector or intercessor besides
Allah, and even if he offers every ransom, it
will not be accepted from him. Such are they
who are given up to destruction because of
that which they have earned. For them will
be a drink of boiling water and a painful
torment because they used to disbelieve.

the land in confusion, his companions
calling him to guidance (saying): 'Come to

only guidance, and we have been
commanded to submit (ourselves) to the

the Day of Resurrection) He will say: "Be!",

be the dominion on the Day when the
Trumpet will be blown. All-Knower of the
unseen and the seen. He is the All-Wise,
Well-Aware (of all things).

74. And (remember) when Ibrahim
(Abraham) said to his father Azar: "Do you
take idols as alihah (gods)? Verily, I see
you and your people in manifest error. 111"

did we show Ibrahim

towards Him Who has created the heavens
and the earth Hanifa, (Islamic Monotheism,
i.e. worshipping none but Allah Alone), and
I am not of Al-Mushrikun" (See V.2: I 05).
80. His people disputed with him. He
said: "Do you dispute with me concerning
Allah while He has guided me, and I fear not
those whom you associate with Him (Allah)
in worship. (Nothing can happen to me)
except when my Lord (Allah) wills
something. My Lord comprehends in His
Knowledge all things. Will you not then
remember?
81. "And how should I fear those whom
you associate in worship with Allah (though
they can neither benefit nor harm), while
you fear not that you have joined in worship
with Allah things for which He has not sent
down to you any authority. (So) which of the
two parties has more right to be in security?
If you but know."
82. It is those who believe (in the

Alone) and confuse not their belief with

times)].

87. And also some of their fathers and
their progeny and their brethren, We chose
them, and We guided them to the Straight
Path.
88. This is the Guidance of Allah with
which He guides whomsoever He wills of
His slaves. But if they had joined in worship
others with Allah, all that they used to do
would have been of no benefit to them.
89. They are those whom We gave the
Book, Al-Hukm (understanding of the
religious laws), and Prophethood. But if
these disbelieve therein (the Book, Al-Hukm
and Prophethood), then, indeed We have
entrusted it to a people (such as the
Companions of Prophet Muhammad .:u 1 .)r-'J ~) who are not disbelievers therein.
90. They are those whom Allah had
guided. So follow their guidance. Say: "No
reward I ask of you for this (the Qur'an). It
is only a reminder for the 'Alamin (mankind
and jinn)."
91. They (the Jews, Quraish pagans,
idolaters) did not estimate Allah with an
estimation due to Him when they said:
"Nothing did Allah send down to any human
being (by revelation)." Say (0 Muhammad

concealing much . And you (believers in
Allah and His Messenger Muhammad ~
r1-, ...i,. .ii,) were taught (through the Qur'an)
that which neither you nor your fathers
knew." Say: "Allah (sent it down)." Then
leave them to play in their vain discussions.

92. And this (the Qur'an) is a blessed
Book which We have sent down, confirming
(the revelations) which came before it, so
that you may warn the Mother of Towns (i.e.
Makkah) and all those around it. Those who
believe in the Hereafter believe in it (the
Qur'an), and they are constant in guarding
their Saldi (prayers).
93. And who can be more unjust than he
who invents a lie against Allah, or says: "A

revelation has come to him in anything; and
who says, "I will reveal the like of what

And also the Statement of AIIAh Jt....; : "Twice shall We punish them and thereafter, they

94. And truly you have come unto Us
alone (without wealth, companions or
anything else) as We created you the first
time. You have left behind you all that
which We had bestowed on you. We see
not with you your intercessors whom you
claimed to be partners with Allah. Now all
relations between you and them have been
cut off, and all that you used to claim has
vanished from you.
95. Verily! It is Allah Who causes the
seed-grain
and the fruit-stone (like
date-stone) to split and sprout. He brings
forth the living from the dead, and it is He
Who brings forth the dead from the living.
Such is Allah, then how are you deluded
away from the truth?
96. (He is the) Cleaver of the daybreak.
He has appointed the night for resting, and
the sun and the moon for reckoning. Such
is the measuring of the All-Mighty, the
All-Knowing.

"While an evil torment encompassed Fir'aun (Pharaoh)'s people; the Fire, they are
exposed to it morning and afternoon, and on the Day when the Hour will be established
(it will be said to the angels): 'Cause Fir'aun (Pharaoh)'s people to enter the severest
torment.' • ,,Y. 40: 45-46).
Narrated Al-Bara· bin 'Azib: The Prophet r-:'J ~ .:ii I J- said,"When a faithful believer is
made to sit in his grave, then (the angels) come to him and he testifies that La i/aha
ii/al/ah wa Anna Muhammad-ur-RasOI-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped but
Allah and Muhammad rl-J ~ .:ii I J- is the Messenger of AIIAh). And that corresponds to
AIIAh's Statement:'Allah will keep firm those who believe with the word that stands firm.'
(V.14:27)." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.2, Hadith No.450).
B. Narrated Anas w .:ii 1 ~J: The Prophet r-1--, ~ .:ii I J- said, "When a human being is
laid in his grave and his companions return and he even hears their footsteps, two
angels come to him and make him sit and ask him: 'What did you use to say about this
man, Muhammad ~J "-,!ls .:ii I J- ?' He will say: 'I testify that he is Allah's slave and His
Messenger.' Then it will be said to him, 'Look at your place in the Hell-fire. Allah has
changed for you a place in Paradise instead of it.'" The Prophet r-1--, ~ .:ii I J- added,
"The dead person will see both his places. But a disbeliever or a hypocrite will say to the
angels, 'I do not know, but I used to say what the people used to say!' It will be said to
him, 'Neither did you know nor did you take the guidance (by following the Qur'An).'
Then he will be hit with an iron hammer between his two ears, and he will cry and that
cry will be heard by whatsoever is near to him except human beings and jinn." (Sahih A/Bukhari, Vol. 2, Hadith No. 422)

the earth (in your graves) or in your father's

Our revelations (this Qur'an) for people who

99. It is He Who sends down water (rain)
from the sky, and with it We bring forth
vegetation of all kinds, and out of it We
bring forth green stalks, from which We
bring forth thick clustered grain. And out of
the date-palm and its spathe come forth
clusters of dates hanging low and near, and
gardens of grapes, olives and pomegranates,
each similar (in kind) yet different (in

they begin to bear, and the ripeness thereof.
Verily! In these things there are signs for
people who believe.
100. Yet, they join the jinn as partners in

them (the jinn); and they attribute falsely
without knowledge sons and daughters to

that (evil) they attribute to Him.

adorned the nearest heaven with lamps," (V.67:5) and said, "The creation of these stars is
for three purposes, i.e. as decoration of the (nearest) heaven, as missiles to hit the devils,
and as signs to guide travellers. So, if anybody tries to find a different interpretation, he is
mistaken and just wastes his efforts, and troubles himself with what is beyond his limited
knowledge." (Sahih AI-Bukh/Jri, Vol. 4, Chap. 3, P. 282).

grasps all vision. He is A/-Latif(the Most

whosoever blinds himself, will do so to his

111 (6:108) The tale of the cave:
Narrated lbn 'UmAr ~ ..ii 1 ~J: AIIAh's Messenger rl-J ~ ..ii I J.... said, "Once three persons
(from the previous nations) were travelling, and suddenly it started raining and they took
shelter in a cave. The entrance of the cave got closed (suddenly by the falling of a huge
rock) while they were inside. They said to each other, 'O You! Nothing can save you except
the truth, so each of you should ask AIIAh's Help by referring to such a deed as he thinks
he did sincerely (i.e., just for gaining AIIAh's Pleasure).' So one of them said, ·o AIIAh! You
know that I had a labourer who worked for me for one Faraq (i.e. three Sa') of rice, but he
departed, leaving it (i.e. his wages). I sowed that Faraq of rice and with its yield I bought
cows (for him). Later on when came to me asking for his wages, I said (to him), 'Go to
those cows and drive them away.' He said to me, 'But you have to pay me only a Faraq of
rice.' I said to him, 'Go to those cows and take them, for they are the product of that Faraq
(of rice).' So he drove them. 0 AIIAh! If you consider that I did that for fear of You, then
please remove the rock.· The rock shifted a bit from the mouth of the cave. The second one
said,
AIIAh, You know that I had old parents whom I used to provide with the milk of my
sheep every night. One night I was delayed and when I came, they had slept. while my wife
and children were crying with hunger. I used not to let them (i.e. my family) drink unless my
parents had drunk first. So I disliked to wake them up and also disliked that they should
sleep without drinking it, I kept on waiting (for them to wake) till it dawned. 0 AIIAh! If You
consider that I did that for fear of You, then please remove the rock.' So the rock shifted
and they could see the sky through it. The (third) one said,
AIIAh! You know that I had a
cousin (i.e. my paternal uncle's daughter) who was most beloved to me and I sought to
seduce her, but she refused, unless I paid her one-hundred DinArs (i.e. gold pieces). So I
collected the amount and brought it to her, and she allowed me to sleep with her. But when
I sat between her legs, she said, 'Be afraid of AIIAh, and do not deflower me but legally.' 'I
got up and left the hundred DinArs (for her). 0 AIIAh! If You consider that I did that for fear
of You than please remove the rock.' So AIIAh released them (removed the rock) and they
came out (of the cave).· [This Hadith indicates that one can only ask AIIAh for help directly
or through his performed good deeds. But to ask AIIAh through the dead or absent
(prophets, saints, spirits, holy men, angels) is absolutely forbidden in lslAm and it is a kind
of polytheism]. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 4, Hadith No. 671).

111. And even if We had sent down unto
them angels, and the dead had spoken unto
them, and We had gathered together all things
before their very eyes, they would not have
believed, unless Allah willed, but most of
them behave ignorantly.
112. And so We have appointed for every
Prophet enemies - Shaydtin (devils) among
mankind and jinn, inspiring one another with
adorned speech as a delusion (or by way of
deception). If your Lord had so willed, they
would not have done it; so leave them alone
with their fabrications. (Tafsir Al-Qurtubi)
113. (And this is in order) that the hearts
of those who disbelieve in the Hereafter may
incline to such (deceit), and that they may
remam pleased with it, and that they may
commit what they are committing (all kinds
ofsins and evil deeds).
114. [Say (0 Muhammad r!--J ~ .:u 1 .;..,)]
"Shall I seek a judge other than Allah while it
is He Who has sent down unto you the Book
(the Qur'an), explained in detail." Those unto
whom We gave the Scripture [the Taurat
(Torah) and the lnjeel (Gospel)] know that it
is revealed from your Lord in truth. So be not
you of those who doubt.
115. And the Word of your Lord has been
fulfilled in truth and in justice. None can
change His Words. And He is the All-Hearer,
the All-Knower.
116. And if you obey most of those on the
earth, they will mislead you far away from
Allah's Path. They follow nothing but
conjectures, and they do nothing but lie.
117. Verily, your Lord! It is He Who
knows best who strays from His Way, and He
knows best the rightly guided ones.
118. So eat of that (meat) on which
Allah's Name has been pronounced (while
slaughtering the animal}, if you are believers
in His Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses,
lessons, signs, revelations, etc.).

119. And why should you not eat of that
(meat) on which Allah's Name has been
pronounced ( at the time of slaughtering the
animal), while He has explained to you in
detail what is forbidden to you, except under
compulsion of necessity? And surely many do
lead (mankind) astray by their own desires
through lack of knowledge. Certainly your
Lord knows best the transgressors.
120. Leave (0 mankind, all kinds of) sin,
open and secret. Verily, those who commit
sin will get due recompense for that which
they used to commit.
121. Eat not (0 believers) of that (meat)
on which Allah's Name has not been
pronounced (at the time of the slaughtering of
the animal), for sure it is Fisq (a sin and
disobedience of Allah). And certainly, the
Shayatin (devils) do inspire their friends
(from mankind) to dispute with you, and if
you obey them 111 [by making Al-Maitah (a
dead animal) legal by eating it], then you
would indeed be Mushrikun (polytheists);
[because they (devils and their friends) made
lawful to you to eat that which Allah has
made unlawful to eat and you obeyed them by
considering it lawful to eat, and by doing so
you worshipped them; and to worship others
besides Allah is polytheism].
122. Is he who was dead (without Faith by
ignorance and disbelief) and We gave him
life (by knowledge and Faith) and set for him
a light (of Belief) whereby he can walk
amongst men like him who is in the
darkness (of disbelief, polytheism and
hypocrisy) from which he can never come
out? Thus it is made fair-seeming to the
disbelievers that which they used to do.

111 (V.6:121) Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, and lbn Jarir: Once while Allah's Messenger
~, '4U .ii 1 ...-1.o was reciting the Verse {9:31) 'Adi bin Hatim said, "O Allah's Messenger!
They do not worship them {i.e., rabbis and monks)." Allah's Messenger f-,J ~ .ii 1 _,i.., said:
"They certainly do. They {i.e., rabbis and monks) made lawful things as unlawful, and
unlawful things as lawful, and they (i.e. Jews and Christians) followed them; and by doing
so, they really worshipped them." (Tafsir At-Taban).

123. And thus We have set up in every
town great ones of its wicked people to plot
therein. But they plot not except against their
ownselves, and they perceive (it) not.
124. And when there comes to them a sign
(from Allah) they say: "We shall not believe
until we receive the like of that which the
Messengers of Allah had received." Allah
knows best with whom to place His Message.
Humiliation and disgrace from Allah and a
severe torment will overtake the criminals
(polytheists, sinners) for that which they used
to plot.
125. And whomsoever Allah wills to
guide, He opens his breast to Islam; and
whomsoever He wills to send astray, He
makes his breast closed and constricted, as if
he is climbing up to the sky. Thus Allah puts
the wrath on those who believe not. 111
126. And this is the Path of your Lord (the
Qur'an and Islam) leading Straight. We have
detailed Our Revelations for a people who
take heed.
127. For them will be the home of peace
(Paradise) with their Lord. And He will be
their Wali (Helper and Protector) because of
what they used to do.
128. And on the Day when He will gather

assembly of jinn! Many did you mislead of
men," and their Auliya' (friends and helpers)
amongst men will say: "Our Lord! We

ways)] and they will not be harmed by anyone who will oppose them (going on a different
path) till Allah's Order (Day of Judgement) is established." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 1, HadTth

have reached our appointed term which You
did appoint for us." He will say: "The Fire be
your dwelling-place, you will dwell therein
forever, except as Allfill may will. Certainly
your Lord is All-Wise, All-Knowing."
129. And thus We do make the Zdlimun
(polytheists
and wrong-doers) Au/iyd'
(supporters and helpers) of one another (in
committing crimes), because of that which
they used to earn.
130. 0 you assembly of jinn and mankind!
"Did not there come to you Messengers from
amongst you, reciting unto you My Verses
and warning you of the meeting of this Day of
yours?" They will say: "We bear witness
against ourselves." It was the life of this
world that deceived them. And they will bear
witness against themselves that they were
disbelievers.
131. This is because your Lord would not
destroy the (populations of) towns for their
wrong-doing (i.e. associating others in
worship along with Allfill) while their people
were unaware (so the Messengers were sent).
132. For all there will be degrees (or
ranks) according to what they did. And your
Lord is not unaware of what they do.
133. And your Lord is Rich (Free of all
needs), full of Mercy; if He wills, He can
destroy you, and in your place make whom
He wills as your successors, as He raised you
from the seed of other people.
134. Surely, that which you are promised
will verily come to pass, and you cannot
escape (from the punishment of Allah).
135. Say (0 Muhammad r-1--J ~.ii,_;..,):
"O my people! Work according to your way,
surely, I too am working (in my way), and
you will come to know for which of us will be
the (happy) end in the Hereafter. Certainly the
Zd/imun (polytheists and wrong-doers) will
not be successful."

136. And they assign to Allah a share of
the tilth and cattle which He has created, and
they say: "This is for Allah according to their
claim, and this is for our (Allah's so-called)
partners." But the share of their (Allah's
so-called) "partners" reaches not Allah, while
the share of Allah reaches their (Allah's
so-called) "partners"! Evil is the way they
judge!
137. And so to many of the Mushrikiin
(polytheists - see V.2: 105) their (Allah's
so-called) "partners" have made fair-seeming
the killing of their children, in order to lead
them to their own destruction and cause
confusion in their religion. And if Allah had
willed, they would not have done so. So leave
them alone with their fabrications.
138. And according to their claim, they
say that such and such cattle and crops are
forbidden, and none should eat of them
except those whom we allow. And (they say)
there are cattle forbidden to be used for
burden (or any other work), and cattle on
which (at slaughtering) the Name of Allah is
not pronounced; lying against Him (Allah).
He will recompense them for what they used
to fabricate.

139. And they say: "What is in the bellies
of such and such cattle (milk or foetus) is for
our males alone, and forbidden to our females
(girls and women), but ifit is born dead, then
all have shares therein." He will punish them
for their attribution ( of such false orders to
Allah). Verily, He is All-Wise, All-Knower.
(Tafsir At-Tabari).
140. Indeed lost are they who have killed
their children, foolishly, without knowledge,
and have forbidden that which Allah has
provided for them, inventing a lie against
Allah. They have indeed gone astray and
were not guided.
141. And it is He Who produces gardens
trellised and untrellised, and date-palms, and
crops of different shape and taste ( their fruits
and their seeds)and olives, and pomegranates,

similar (in kind) and different (in taste). Eat
of their fruit when they ripen, but pay the due
thereof (its Zakiit, according to Allah's
Orders 1/10th or 1120th) on the day of its
harvest, and waste not by extravagance 111 .
Verily, He likes not Al-Musrifiln (those who
waste by extravagance),
142. And of the cattle (are some) for
burden (like camels) and (some are) small
(unable to carry burden like sheep and goats for food, meat, milk and wool ). Eat of what
Allah has provided for you, and follow not
the footsteps of Shaitan (Satan). Surely he is
to you an open enemy.
143. Eigh,t pairs: of the sheep two (male
and female), 121 and of the goats two (male and
female). Say: "Has He forbidden the two
males or the two females, or (the young)
which the wombs of the two females enclose?

shepherd saying: "Be afraid of Allah, you have taken the provision from me which Allah
gave me." The shepherd said: "What an amazing thing! A wolf sitting on its tail speaks to
me in the language of a human being." The wolf said: "Shall I tell you something more
amazing than this? There is Muhammad ,1.-J ~ 4111 .s1-" the Messenger of Allah in Yathrib
(AI-Madinah) informing the people about the news of the past." Then the shepherd (after
hearing that) proceeded (towards AI-Madinah) driving his sheep till he entered AI-Madinah,
cornered his sheep in a place, and came to Allah's Messenger (Muhammad r!:,-, ~ 4111 J-")
and informed the whole story.

who were before them, (they argued falsely
with Allah's Messengers), till they tasted Our
Wrath. Say: "Have you any knowledge
(proof) that you can produce before us?
Verily, you follow nothing but guess and you
do nothing but lie."
149. Say: "With Allah is the perfect proof
and argument, (i.e. the Oneness of Allah, the
sending of His Messengers and His Holy
Books to mankind); had He so willed, He
would indeed have guided you all."
150. Say: "Bring forward your witnesses,
who can testify that Allah has forbidden this.
Then if they testify, testify not you (0
Muhammad r1--J ~ .iJ 1 ..,.i..,) with them. And
you should not follow the vain desires of such
as treat Our Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses,
lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) as falsehoods,
and such as believe not in the Hereafter, and
they hold others as equal (in worship) with
their Lord."
151. Say (0 Muhammad r1--J .,.i; .:i, 1 j-o):
"Come, I will recite what your Lord has
prohibited you from: Join not anything in
worship with Him; be good and dutiful to
your parents; kill not your children because of
poverty - We provide sustenance for you
and for them; come not near to Al-Fawahish
(shameful sins, illegal sexual intercourse)
whether committed openly or secretly; and
kill not anyone whom Alliih has forbidden,
except for a just cause (according to Isliimic

may understand.

truth even if a near relative is concerned, and

fulfil the Covenant of Allah. This He
commands you, that you may remember111 •
153. "And verily, this (i.e. Allah's
Commandments mentioned in the above two
Verses 151 and 152) is My Straight Path, so
follow it, and follow not ( other) paths, for
they will separate you away from His Path.
This He has ordained for you that you may
become AI-Muttaqun (the pious - see
V.2:2)."
154. Then, We gave Musil (Moses) the
Book [the Tauriit (Torah)], to complete (Our
Favour) upon those who would do right, and
explaining all things in detail and a guidance
and a mercy that they might believe in the
meeting with their Lord.
155. And this is a blessed Book (the
Qur'iin) which We have sent down, so follow
it and fear Alliih (i.e. do not disobey His
Orders), that you may receive mercy (i.e. be
saved from the torment of Hell).
156. Lest you (pagan Arabs) should say:
"The Book was sent down only to two sects
before us (the Jews and the Christians), and
for our part, we were in fact unaware of what
they studied."

157. Or lest you (pagan Arabs) should
say: "If only the Book had been sent down to
us, we would surely have been better guided
than they (Jews and Christians)." So now has
come unto you a clear proof (the Qur'iin)
from your Lord, and a guidance and a mercy.
Who then does more wrong than one who
rejects the Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses,
lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of Alliih and
turns away therefrom? We shall requite those
who tum away from Our Aydt with an evil
torment, because of their turning away (from
them). [Ta/sir At-Tabari]

than that the angels should come to them, or
that your Lord (Allah) should come, or that

Allah, while He is the Lord of all things? No
person earns any (sin) except against himself
(only), and no bearer of burdens shall bear
the burden of another. Then unto your Lord is
your return, so He will tell you that wherein
you have been differing."
165. And
it is
He Who has made
you generations coming after generations,
replacing each other on the earth. And He has
raised you in ranks, some above others that
He may try you in that which He has
bestowed on you. Surely your Lord is Swift in
retribution, and certainly He is Oft-Forgiving,
Most Merciful.

So as for those whose scale (of good deeds)
will be heavy, they will be the successful (by
entering Paradise).
9. And as for those whose scale will be

denied and rejected Our Aydt (proofs,

10. And surely, We gave you authority on

11. And surely, We created you (your

noble shape ofa human being); then We told
the angels, "Prostrate yourselves to Adam",
and they prostrated themselves, except lb/is

Whoever of them (mankind) will follow you,
then surely I will fill Hell with you all."
19. "And O Adam! Dwell you and your

wish, but approach not this tree otherwise you
both will be of the Zd/imun (unjust and

20. Then Shaitdn (Satan) whispered

that which was hidden from them of their
private parts (before); he said: "Your Lord
did not forbid you this tree save that you

21. And he [Shaitdn (Satan)] swore by
Allah to them both (saying): "Verily, I am

22. So he misled them with deception.
Then when they tasted of the tree, that which
was hidden from them of their shame (private
parts) became manifest to them and they
began to cover themselves with the leaves of
Paradise (in order to cover their shame). And
their Lord called out to them (saying): "Did I

(Satan) deceive you, as he got your parents
[Adam and Hawwa' (Eve)] out of Paradise,
stripping them of their raiments, to show them
their private parts. Verily, he and Qabiluhu

We made the Shaydtin (devils) Auliyd'

28. And when they commit a Fdhishah

state, and every kind of unlawful sexual
intercourse), they say: "We found our fathers
doing it, and Allah has commanded it on us."
Say: "Nay, Allah never commands Fdhishah.
Do you say of Allah what you know not?"

111 (V.7:26) It is said that the pagan Arabs in the Pre-Islamic Period of Ignorance used to do
Tawaf (going round) of the Ka'bah in a naked state. So when Islam became victorious and
Makkah was conquered, the pagans and the polytheists were forbidden to enter Makkah,
and none was allowed to do Tawaf of the Ka'bah in a naked state.

29. Say (0 Muhammad r-1--J ~ .:u, J-,,): My
Lord has commanded justice and (said) that
you should face Him only (i.e. worship none
but Allah and face the Qiblah, i.e. the Ka 'bah
at Makkah during prayers) in every place of
worship, in prayers (and not to face other
false deities and idols), and invoke Him only
making your religion sincere to Him (by not
joining in worship any partner with Him and
with the intention that you are doing your
deeds for Allah's sake only). As He brought
you (into being) in the beginning, so shall you
be brought into being [on the Day of
Resurrection in two groups, one as a blessed
one (believers), and the other as a wretched
one (disbelievers)].
30. A group He has guided, and a group
deserved to be in error; (because) surely they
took the Shaydtin (devils) as A uliyd '
(protectors and helpers) instead of Allah, and
think that they are guided.
31. 0 Children of Adam! Take your
adornment (bt wearing your clean clothes),
while praying 11 and going round (the Tawdf
of ) the Ka 'bah, and eat and drink but waste
not by extravagance, certainly He (Allah)
likes not Al-Musrifun (those who waste by
extravagance).

111 (V.7:31) It is obligatory to wear the clothes while praying. And the Statement of Allah

~ J _;,,:

"Take your adornment [(by wearing your clean clothes) covering completely the 'Aurah
(covering of one's 'Aurah means: while praying, a male must cover himself with clothes
from the umbilicus of his abdomen up to his knees, and it is better that both his shoulders
should be covered. And a female must cover all her body and feet except face, and it is
better that both her hands are also covered)], while praying and going round (the Tawaf of)
the Ka'bah."
In how many (what sort of) clothes a woman should pray? 'lkrimah said, "If she can cover
all her body with one garment, it is sufficient."*
• It is agreed by the majority of the religious scholars that a woman while praying should
cover herself completely except her face, and it is better that she should cover her hands
with gloves or cloth. but her feet must be covered either with a long dress or she must wear
socks to cover her feet. This verdict is based on the Prophet's statement (Abu DawOd).
Narrated 'Aishah ~ .ii, ..r4;: Allah's Messenger f.'.'.'J <,I& .iii, J- used to offer the Fajr prayer
and some believing women covered with their veiling sheets used to attend the Fajr prayer
with him, and then they would return to their homes unrecognized. (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1,

disbelievers will not share them)." Thus We
explain the Aydt (Islamic laws) in detail for
people who have knowledge.
33. Say (0 Muhammad r-'J......,... ..:»1 ..,.i..,):
"(But) the things that my Lord has indeed
forbidden are AI-Fawdhish (great evil sins
and every kind of unlawful sexual
intercourse) whether committed openly or
secretly, sins (of all kinds), unrighteous
oppression, joining partners (in worship) with
Allah for which He has given no authority,
and saying things about Allah of which you

34. And every nation has its appointed
term; when their term comes, neither can they
delay it nor can they advance it an hour (or a
moment).
35. 0 Children of Adam! If there come to
you Messengers from amongst you, reciting
to you My Verses, then whosoever becomes
pious and righteous, on them shall be no fear
nor shall they grieve.
36. But those who reject Our Aydt
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations) and treat them with arrogance,
they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire, they
will abide therein forever.
37. Who is more unjust than one who
invents a lie against Allah or rejects His Aydt
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations)? For such their appointed portion
(good things of this worldly life and their
period of stay therein) will reach them from
the Book (of Decrees) until when Our
Messengers (the angel of death and his
assistants) come to them to take their souls,

they (the angels) will say: "Where are those
whom you used to invoke and worship
besides Allah," they will reply, "They have
vanished and deserted us." And they will bear
witness against themselves, that they were
disbelievers.
38. (Allah) will say: "Enter you in the
company of nations who passed away before
you, of men and jinn, into the Fire." Every
time a new nation enters, it curses its sister
nation (that went before) until they will be
gathered all together in the Fire. The last of
them will say to the first of them: "Our Lord!
These misled us, so give them a double
torment of the Fire." He will say: "For each
one there is double (torment), but you know
not."
39. The first of them will say to the last of
them: "You were not better than us, so taste
the torment for what you used to earn."

that Allah had guided us! Indeed, the
Messengers of our Lord did come with the
truth." And it will be cried out to them: "This
is the Paradise which you have inherited for
what you used to do."
44. And the dwellers of Paradise will call
out to the dwellers of the Fire (saying): "We
have indeed found true what our Lord had
promised us; have you also found true what
your Lord promised (warnings)?" They shall
say: "Yes." Then a crier will proclaim
between them: "The Curse of Allah is on the
Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers)."
45. Those who hindered (men) from the

crooked, and they were disbelievers in the

places) will be men (whose good and evil
deeds would be equal in scale), who would

benefit to you were your great numbers {and
hoards of wealth), and your arrogance
(against Faith)?"
49. Are they those, of whom you swore
that Allah would never show them mercy.
(Behold! It has been said to them): "Enter
Paradise, no fear shall be on you, nor shall
you grieve."

50. And the dwellers of the Fire will call
to the dwellers of Paradise: "Pour on us some
water or anything that Allah has provided you
with." They will say: "Both (water and
provision) Allah has forbidden to the
disbelievers."
51. "Who took their religion as an
amusement and play, and the life of the world
deceived them." So this Day We shall forget
them as they forgot their meeting of this Day,
and as they used to reject Our Aydt (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations).

52. Certainly, We have brought them a
Book (the Qur'an) which We have explained
in detail with knowledge, - a guidance and a
mercy to a people who believe.

53. Await they just for the final fullfilment
of the event? On the Day the event is finally
fulfilled (i.e. the Day of Resurrection), those
who neglected it before will say: "Verily, the
Messengers of our Lord did come with the
truth, now are there any intercessors for us
that they might intercede on our behalf? Or
could we be sent back (to the first life of the
world) so that we might do (good) deeds
other than those (evil) deeds which we used
to do?" Verily, they have Jost their ownselves
(i.e. destroyed themselves) and that which
they used to fabricate (invoking and
worshipping others besides Allah) has gone
away from them.
54. Indeed your Lord is Allah, Who
created the heavens and the earth in Six Days,
and then He rose over (Jstawd) the Throne
(really in a manner that suits His Majesty). He
brings the night as a cover over the day,

seeking it rapidly, and (He created) the sun,
the moon, the stars subjected to His
Command. Surely, His is the Creation and
Commandment. Blessed is Allii.h, the Lord of
the 'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that
exists)!

55. Invoke your Lord with humility and in
secret. He likes not the aggressors.
56. And do not do mischief on the earth,
after it has been set in order, and invoke Him
with fear and hope. Surely, Allii.h's Mercy is
(ever) near unto the good-doers.
57. And it is He Who sends the winds as
heralds of glad tidings, going before His
Mercy (rain). Till when they have carried a
heavy-laden cloud, We drive it to a land that
is dead, then We cause water (rain) to
descend thereon. Then We produce every
kind of fruit therewith. Similarly, We shall
raise up the dead, so that you may remember
or take heed.
58. The vegetation of a good land comes
forth (easily) by the Permission of its Lord;
and that which is bad, brings forth nothing but
(a little) with difficulty. Thus do We explain
variously the Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses,
lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) for a people
who give thanks.

59. Indeed, We sent Niih (Noah) to his
people and he said: "O my people! Worship
Allii.h! You have no other lldh (God) but
Him. (Ld ildha illalldh: none has the right to
be worshipped but Allah). Certainly, I fear for
you the torment of a Great Day!"
60. The leaders of his people said:
"Verily, we see you in plain error."
61. [Nfrh (Noah)] said: "O my people!
There is no error in me, but I am a Messenger
from the Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind,jinn

already fallen on you from your Lord.
Dispute you with me over names which you

72. So We saved him and those who were
with him by a mercy from Us, and We cut the
roots of those who belied Our Ayat (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations,
etc.); and they were not believers.
73. And to Thamud (people, We sent)
their brother Salih. He said: "O my people!
Worship Allah! You have no other I/ah (God)
but Him. (Lei ilaha illalldh: none has the right
to be worshipped but Allah). Indeed there has
come to you a clear sign (the miracle of the
coming out of a huge she-camel from the
midst of a rock) from your Lord. This
she-camel of Allah is a sign unto you; so you
leave her to graze in Allah's earth, and touch
her not with harm, lest a painful torment
should seize you.
74. And remember when He made you

habitations in the land, you build for
yourselves palaces in plains, and carve out
homes in the mountains. So remember the

do not go about making mischief on the

75. The leaders of those who were
arrogant among his people said to those who
were counted weak - to such of them as
believed: "Know you that Salih is one sent

(V.7:87):
A). Narrated 'Abdullah bin 'Umar ~ .ii 1;r-1-;: Allah's Messenger rL-, ~ .ii 1 ~ said,
"Surely! Everyone of you is a guardian and 1s responsible for his charges: The Imam (ruler)
of the people is a guardian and is responsible for his subjects; a man is the guardian of his
family (household) and is responsible for his subjects; a woman is the guardian of her
husband's home and of his children and is responsible for them; and the slave of a man is
a guardian of his master's property and is responsible for it. Surely, everyone of you is a
guardian and responsible for his charges." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Hadith No. 252).
B). Narrated Tarif Abi Tamimah: I saw Safwan and Jundub and Safwan's companions
when Jundub was advising. They said, "Did you hear something from Allah's Messenger
~ .ii 1,,i..,?" Jundub said, "I heard him saying, 'Whoever does a good deed in order to
show-off, AITah will expose his intentions on the Day of Resurrection (before the people),
and whoever puts the people into difficulties, Allah will put him into difficulties on the Day of
Resurrection.' • The people said (to Jundub), "Advise us.' He said, "The first thing of the
human body to putrefy is the abdomen, so he who can eat nothing but good food (Halal and
earned lawfully) should do so, and he who does as much as he can that nothing intervene
between him and Paradise by not shedding even a handful of blood, (i.e. murdering) should
do so.' [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Hadith No. 266].
C). Narrated Anas bin Malik ...., .ii 1 ._,.;,;: While the Prophet r1--, ~ .ii I ii:' and I were coming
out of the mosque, a man met us outside the gate. The man said, 0 Allah's Messenger!
When will be the Hour?" The Prophet rLi ~ .ii 1_.L, asked him, "What have you prepared
for it?" The man became afraid and ashamed and then said, "O Allah's Messenger! I
haven't prepared for it much of Saum (fasts), Sa/at (prayers) or charitable gifts but I love
Allah and His Messenger." The Prophet ,J-,, ~ .ii 1._.L., said, "You will be with the one whom
you love.' [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Had1th No. 267J.
D). Narrated Abu Dharr ...., .ii 1..,.;,;: Once I went to him (the Prophett-,, ~ .ii 1.;..,) and he
said, "By Allah in Whose Hana my life is (or probably said, "By Allah, except whom none
has the right to be worshipped)" whoever had camels or cows or sheep and did not pay
their Zakat, those animals will be brought on the Day of Resurrection far bigger and fatter
than before and they will tread him under their hooves, and will butt him with their horns,
and (those animals will come in circle): When the last does its turn, the first will start again,
and this punishment will go on till Allah has finished the judgements amongst the people.'

88. The chiefs of those who were arrogant
among his people said: "We shall certainly
drive you out, 0 Shu'aib, and those who have
believed with you from our town, or else you
(all) shall return to our religion." He said:
"Even though we hate it! ?"

89. "We should have invented a lie
against Allah ifwe returned to your religion,
after Allah has rescued us from it. And it is
not for us to return to it unless Allah, our
Lord, should will. Our Lord comprehends all
things in His Knowledge. In Allah (Alone) we
put our trust. Our Lord! Judge between us and
our people in truth, for You are the Best of
those who give judgment."
90. The chiefs of those who disbelieved
among his people said (to their people): "If
you follow Shu'aib, be sure then you will be
the losers!"
91. So the earthquake seized them and
they lay ( dead), prostrate in their homes.
92. Those who belied Shu'aib, became as
if they had never dwelt there (in their homes).
Those who belied Shu'aib, they were the
losers.
93. Then he (Shu'aib) turned from them
and said: "0 my people! I have indeed
conveyed my Lord's Messages unto you and I
have given you good advice. Then how can I
sorrow for the disbelieving people's
(destruction)."

94. And We sent no Prophet unto any
town (and they denied him), but We seized its
people with suffering from extreme poverty
(or loss in wealth) and loss of health (and
calamities), so that they might humiliate
themselves (and repent to Allah).
95. Then We changed the evil for the
good, until they increased in number and in
wealth, and said: "Our fathers were touched

all of a sudden while they were unaware.
96. And if the people of the towns had
believed and had the Taqwd (piety), certainly,
We should have opened for them blessings
from the heaven and the earth, but they belied

their Messengers with clear proofs, but they
were not such as to believe in that which they

102. And most of them We found not true

136. So We took retribution from them. We
drowned them in the sea, because they belied
Our Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons,

137. And We made the people who were
considered weak to inherit the eastern parts of
the land and the western parts thereof which
We have blessed. And the fair Word of your
Lord was fulfilled for the Children oflsrael,
because of their endurance. And We
destroyed completely all the great works and
buildings which Fir'aun (Pharaoh) and his
people erected.
138. And We brought the Children of
Israel (with safety) across the sea, and they
came upon a people devoted to some of their
idols (in worship). They said: "O Musa
(Moses)! Make for us an i/ahr 11 (a god) as
they have alihah (gods)." He said: "Verily,
you are a people who know not (the Majesty
and Greatness of Allah and what is obligatory
upon you, i.e. to worship none but Allah
Alone, the One and the Only God of all that
exists)."
139. [Musa (Moses) added:] "Verily,
these people will be destroyed for that which
they are engaged in (idols-worship). And all
that they are doing is in vain."
140. He said: "Shall I seek for you an ilah
(a god) other than Allah, while He has given
you superiority over the 'Alamin (mankind
and jinn of your time)."
141. And (remember) when We rescued
you from Fir'aun's (Pharaoh) people, who
were afflicting you with the worst torment,
killing your sons and letting your women live.
And in that was a great trial from your Lord.

142. And We appointed for Musa (Moses)
thirty nights and added (to the period) ten
(more), and he completed the term, appointed
by his Lord, of forty nights. And Musa
(Moses) said to his brother Hamn (Aaron):
"Replace me among my people, act in the
Right Way (by ordering the people to obey
Allah and to worship Him Alone) and follow
not the way of the Mufsidun (mischiefmakers )."
143. And when Musa (Moses) came at the
time and place appointed by Us, and his Lord
(Allah) spoke to him; he said: "O my Lord!
Show me (Yourself), that I may look upon
You." Allah said: "You cannot see Me, but
look upon the mountain; if it stands still in its
place then you shall see Me." So when his
Lord appeared to the mountain111 , He made it
collapse to dust, and Musa (Moses) fell down
unconscious. Then when he recovered his
senses he said: "Glory be to You, I turn to
You in repentance and I am the first of the
believers."
144. (Allah) said: "O Musa (Moses) I
have chosen you above men by My Messages,
and by My speaking (to you). So hold that
which I have given you and be of the
grateful."

the lesson to be drawn from all things and the
explanation for all things (and said): Hold
unto these with firmness, and enjoin your
people to take the better therein. I shall show
you the home of AI-Fdsiqun (the rebellious,
disobedient to Allah).

etc.), they will not believe in them. And if
they see the way of righteousness
(monotheism, piety, and good deeds), they
will not adopt it as the Way, but if they see
the way of error (polytheism, crimes and evil
deeds), they will adopt that way, that is
because they have rejected Our Aydt (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations,
etc.) and were heedless (to learn a lesson)
from them.
147. Those who deny Our Aydt (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.)
and the Meeting in the Hereafter (Day of
Resurrection,), vain are their deeds. Are they
requited with anything except what they used to
do?
148. And the people of MOsa (Moses)
made in his absence, out of their ornaments,
the image of a calf (for worship). It had a
sound (as if it was mooing). Did they not see
that it could neither speak to them nor guide
them to the way? They took it (for worship)
and they were Zalimiin (wrong-doers).
149. And when they regretted and saw
that they had gone astray, they (repented and)
said: "If our Lord have not mercy upon us
and forgive us, we shall certainly be of the
losers."

150. And when MOsa (Moses) returned to
his people, angry and grieved, he said: "What
an evil thing is that which you have done (i.e.
worshipping the calf) during my absence. Did
you hasten and go ahead as regards the matter
of your Lord (you left His worship)?" And he
threw down the Tablets and seized his brother
by (the hair of) his head and dragged him
towards him. HarO.n (Aaron) said: "O son of
my mother! Indeed the people judged me
weak and were about to kill me, so make not
the enemies rejoice over me, nor put me

154. And when the anger of Musa

Tablets; and in their inscription was guidance
and mercy for those who fear their Lord.
155. And Musa (Moses) chose out of his
people seventy (of the best) men for Our
appointed time and place of meeting, and
when they were seized with a violent
earthquake, he said: "O my Lord, if it had
been Your Will, You could have destroyed
them and me before; would You destroy us

is only Your Trial by which You lead astray
whom You will, and keep guided whom You

have turned unto You." He said: (As to) My

159. And of the people ofMftsa (Moses)
there is a community who lead (the men) with
truth and establish justice therewith (i.e. judge
among men with truth and justice).
160. And We divided them into twelve
tribes (as distinct) nations. We revealed to
Musa (Moses) when his people asked him for
water (saying): "Strike the stone with your
stick", and there gushed forth out of it twelve
springs, each group knew its own place for
water. We shaded them with the clouds and
sent down upon them AI-Manna111 and the
quails (saying): "Eat of the good things with
which We have provided you." They harmed
Us not but they used to harm themselves.
161. And (remember) when it was said to
them: "Dwell in this town (Jerusalem) and eat
therefrom wherever you wish, and say, '(O
Allah) forgive our sins'; and enter the gate
prostrate (bowing with humility). We shall
forgive you your wrong-doings. We shall
increase (the reward) for the good-doers."
162. But those among them who did
wrong changed the word that had been told to
them. So We sent on them a torment from the
heaven in return for their wrong-doings. 121
163. Ap.d

ask them (0 Muhammad J.-.,,

sea; when they transgressed in the matter of
the Sabbath (i.e. Saturday): when their fish
came to them openly on the Sabbath day, and
did not come to them on the day they had no
Sabbath. Thus We made a trial of them, for
they used to rebel against Allah's Command
(disobey Allah) [see the Qur'an: V.4:154 and
its footnote].
164. And when a community among them
said: "Why do you preach to a people whom
Allah is about to destroy or to punish with a
severe torment?" (The preachers) said: "In

165. So when they forgot the remindings
that had been given to them, We rescued
those who forbade evil, but We seized those
who did wrong with a severe torment because
they used to rebel against Allah's Command
(disobey Allah).

166. So when they exceeded the limits of
what they were prohibited, We said to them:
"Be you monkeys, despised and rejected." 111
167. And (remember) when your Lord
declared that He would certainly keep on
sending against them (i.e. the Jews), till the
Day of Resurrection, those who would afflict
them with a humiliating torment. Verily, your
Lord is Quick in Retribution (for the
disobedient, wicked) and certainly He is
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful (for the
obedient and those who beg Allah's
Forgiveness).

168. And We have broken them (i.e. the
Jews) up into various, separate groups on the
earth: some of them are righteous and some
are away from that. And We tried them with
good (blessings) and evil (calamities) in order
that they might turn (to Allah's Obedience).
169. Then after them succeeded an (evil)
generation, which inherited the Book, but
they chose (for themselves) the goods of this
low life (evil pleasures of this world) saying
(as an excuse): "(Everything) will be forgiven
to us." And if (again) the offer ofthe like
(evil pleasures of this world) came their way,
they would (again) seize them (would commit
those sins). Was not the covenant of the Book
taken from them that they would not say
about Allah anything but the truth? And they
have studied what is in it (the Book). And the

170. And as to those who hold fast to the
Book (i.e. act on its teachings) and perform
As-Saldt (Jqdmat-as-Saldt), certainly We
shall never waste the reward of those who do
righteous deeds.
171. And (remember) when We raised the
mountain over them as if it had been a

184. Do they not reflect? There is no
madness , in their companion (Muhammad

185. Do they not look in the dominion of
the heavens and the earth and all things that
Allah has created; and that it may be that the
end of their lives is near. In what message
after this will they then believe?
186. Whomsoever Allah sends astray,
none can guide him; and He lets them
wander blindly in their transgressions.

187. They ask you about the Hour (Day
of Resurrection): "When will be its
appointed time?" Say: "The knowledge
thereof is with my Lord (Alone). None can
reveal its time but He. Heavy is its burden
through the heavens and the earth. It shall
not come upon you except all of a sudden."
They ask you as if you have a good
knowledge of it. Say: "The knowledge
thereof is with Allah (Alone), but most of
mankind know not." 111
188. Say (0 Muhammad r1--,- J ..,L, ..1! I c)-.,,) :
"I possess no power over benefit or hurt to

indeed be among the grateful."
190. But when He gave them (the
polytheist and his wife) a Sd/ih (good in
every aspect) child, they ascribed partners
to Him (Allah) in that which He has given
to them. High be Allah, Exalted above all
that they ascribe as partners to Him. (Tafsir
Ibn Kathir).
191. Do they attribute as partners to Allah
those who
created nothing but they
themselves are created?
192. No help can they give them, nor can
they help themselves.
193. And if you call them to guidance,
they follow you not. It is the same for you
whether you call them or you keep silent.
194. Verily, those whom you call upon
besides Allah are slaves like you. So call
upon them and let them answer you if you are
truthful.
195. Have they feet wherewith they walk?
Or have they hands wherewith they hold? Or
have they eyes wherewith they see? Or have
they ears wherewith, they hear? Say (0
Muhammad ~ J "#' .1i I J-): "Call your (socalled) partners (of Allah) and then plot
against me, and give me no respite!
196. Verily,
my
Wali (Protector,
Supporter, and Helper) is Allah Who has
revealed the Book {the Qur'an), and He
protects (supports and helps) the righteous.
197. And those whom you call upon
besides Him (Allah) cannot help you nor can
they help themselves.
198. And if you call them to guidance,
they hear not and you will see them looking at
you, yet they see not.
199. Show forgiveness, enjoin what is
good, and tum away from the foolish (i.e.
don't punish them).

201. Verily, those who are Al-Muttaqun
(the pious - see V.2:2), when an evil thought
comes to them from Shaitdn(Satan), they
remember (Allah), and (indeed) they then see
(aright).
202. But (as for) their brothers (the devils)
they (i.e. the devils) plunge them deeper into
error, and they never stop short.
203. And if you do not bring them a
miracle [according to their (i.e. Quraishpagans') proposal], thp say: "Why have
you not brought it?" 11 Say: "I but follow
what is revealed to me from my Lord.
This
(the Qur'an)
is
nothing but
evidences from your Lord, and a guidance
and a mercy for a people who believe."
204. So, when the Qur'an is recited,
listen to it, and be silent that you may
receive mercy. [i.e. during the compulsory
congregational prayers when the Imam (of
a mosque) is leading the prayer ( except
Surat AI-Fdtihah), and also when he is
delivering the Friday-prayer Khutbah].

matters of difference among you, and obey
Allah and His Messenger (Muhammad

2. The believers are only those who,
when Allah is mentioned, feel a fear in

their trust in their Lord (Alone);
3. Who perfonn As-Sa/tit (lqamat-asSalat) and spend out of that We have
provided them.
4. It is they who are the believers in truth.
For them are grades of dignity with their

your home with the truth; and verily, a party
among the believers disliked it,
6. Disputing with you concerning the truth
after it was made manifest, as if they were
being driven to death, while they were
looking (at it).

7. And (remember) when Allah promised
you (Muslims) one of the two parties (of the
enemy i.e. either the army or the caravan) that
it should be yours; you wished that the one
not armed (the caravan) should be yours, but
Allah willed to justify the truth by His Words

and to cut off the roots of the disbelievers
(i.e. in the battle ofBadr).
8. That He might cause the truth to
triumph and bring falsehood to nothing, even

9. (Remember) when you sought help of
your Lord and He answered you (saying): "I
will help you with a thousand of the angels
each behind the other (following one another)
in succession."

10. Allah made it only as glad tidings, and
that your hearts be at rest therewith. And
there is no victory except from Allah. Verily,
Allah is All-Mighty, All-Wise.
11. (Remember) when He covered you
with a slumber as a security from Him, and
He caused water (rain) to descend on you
from the sky, to clean you thereby and to
remove from you the Rijz (whispering, evilsuggestions) of Shaitcin (Satan), and to
strengthen your hearts, and make your feet
firm thereby.
12. (Remember) when your Lord revealed
to the angels, "Verily, I am with you, so keep
firm those who have believed. I will cast
terror into the hearts of those who have
disbelieved, so strike them over the necks,
and smite over all their fingers and toes."
13. This is because they defied and
disobeyed Allah and His Messenger. And
whoever defies and disobeys Allah and His
Messenger, then verily, Allah is Severe in
punishment.
14. This is (the torment), so taste it; and
surely for the disbelievers is the torment of

them while they hinder (men) from Al-Masjid
AI-Hardm, and they are not its guardians?
None can be its guardians
except AlMuttaqun (the pious - See V.2:2), but most
of them know not.
35. Their Saldt (prayer) at the House (of
Allfill, i.e. the Ka 'bah at Makkah) was
nothing but whistling and clapping of hands.
Therefore taste the punishment because you
used to disbelieve.

Allfill, and so will they continue to spend it;

who disbelieve will be gathered unto Hell.
37. In order that Allah may distinguish the
wicked (disbelievers, polytheists and doers of
evil deeds) from the good (believers of
Islfunic Monotheism and doers of righteous
deeds), and put the wicked (disbelievers,
polytheists and doers of evil deeds) one over
another, heap them together and cast them
into Hell. Those! it is they who are the losers.
38. Say to those who have disbelieved, if
they cease (from disbelief), their past will be
forgiven. But if they return (thereto), then the
examples of those (punished) before them
have already preceded (as a warning).

said, "No one of mankind can overcome you

He is All-Mighty, All-Wise.

Allah is Sufficient for you and for the
believers who follow you.
65. 0 Prophet (Muhammad r-1- 1 ~ .'i I J-) !
Urge the believers to fight. If there are twenty
steadfast persons amongst you, they will
overcome two hundreds, and if there be a
hundred steadfast persons they will overcome
a thousand of those who disbelieve, because
they (the disbelievers) are people who do not

66. Now Allah has lightened your (task),
for He knows that there is weakness in you.
So if there are of you a hundred steadfast

67. It is not for a Prophet that he should
have prisoners of war (and free them with

"If Allah knows any good in your hearts, He

72. Verily, those who believed, and

is "That if you do not do what We (Allah) have ordered you to do, [i.e. all of you (Muslims of
the whole world) do not become allies as one united block to make Allah's religion Islam)
victorious, there will be a great Fitnah (polytheism, wars, battles, killing, robbing, a great
mischief, corruption and oppression.)"). And it is Fitnah to have many Khalifahs ( Muslim
rulers), as it has b~en mentioned in Sahih Muslim by 'Arfajah, who said: I heard Allah's
Messenger i-1-- J ~ .ii I J-- saying: "When you all (Muslims) are united (as one block) under
a single Khalifah (chief Muslim ruler), and a man comes up to disintegrate you and
separate you into different groups, then kill that man."
Also there is another narra~ion in Sahih Muslim: Narrated Abu Sa'id AI-Khudri
.'ii I er"J:
Allah's Messenger r-1--- J ~ .ii I J-- said: "If the Muslim world gave the Bai'a (pledge) to two
Khalifah (chief Muslim rulers), the first one who was given the Bai'a (pledge) first will remain
as the Khalifah, then kill the latter (the second) one.·
So it is a legal obligation, from the above-mentioned evident proofs (from the Qur'an and
the Prophet's statement), that there shall not be more than one Khalifah (a chief Muslim
ruler) for the whole Muslim world or otherwise there will be a great Fitnah (mischief and
evil.) amongst the Muslims, the ultimate results of which will not be worthy of praise.

1. Freedom from (all) obligations (is
declared) from Allfilt and His Messenger
(r-1--J ~ l» I ~ ) to those of the Mushrikun
(polytheists, pagans, idolaters, disbelievers in
the Oneness of Allfilt), with whom you made
a treaty.

2. So travel freely (0 Mushrikun - See
V.2: 105) for four months (as you will)
throughout the land, but know that you cannot
escape (from the punishment of) Allfilt; and
Allfilt will disgrace the disbelievers.
3. And a declaration from Allfilt and His
Messenger to mankind on the greatest day
(the 10th ofDhul-Hiiiah-the 12th month of
lslfunic calendar) that Allfilt is free from (all)
obligations to the Mushrikun (See V.2:105)
and so is His Messenger. So if you
(Mushrikun) repent, it is better for you, but if
you turn away, then know that you cannot
escape (from the Punishment of) All~. And
give tidings (0 Muhammad r-1..J ~ ..ii I ~ )
of a painful torment to those who disbelieve.
4. Except those of the Mushrikun (see
V.2:105) with whom you have a treaty, and
who have not subsequently failed you in
aught, nor have supported anyone against
you. So fulfil their treaty to them for the end
of their term. Surely Allah loves AlMuttaqf'm (the pious - See V.2:2).

5. Then when the Sacred Months (the 1st,
7th, 11th, and 12th months of the lslfunic
calendar) have passed, then kill the
Mushrikun (See V.2: I 05) wherever you find
them, and capture them and besiege them, .and
lie in wait for them in each and every ambush.
But if they repent and perform As-Sa/at

6. And if anyone of the Mushrikun
(polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in
the Oneness of Allah) seeks your protection,
then grant him protection so that he may hear
the Word of Allah (the Qur'fut), and then
escort him to where he can be secure, that is
because they are men who know not.
7. How can there be a covenant with Allah
and with His Messenger for the Mushrikun
(polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in
the Oneness of Allah) except those with
whom you made a covenant near Al-Masjidal-Haram (at Makkah)? So long as they are
true to you, stand you true to them. Verily,
Allah loves Al-Muttaqun (the pious - See
V.2:2).
8. How (can there be such a covenant with
them) that when you are overpowered by
them, they regard not the ties, either of
kinship or of covenant with you? With (good
words from) their mouths they please you, but
their hearts are averse to you, and most of
them are Fiisiqim (rebellious, disobedient to
Allfill).
9. They have purchased with the Ayat
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.) of Allfill a little gain, and
they hindered men from His Way; evil indeed
is that which they used to do.
10. With regard to a believer, they respect
not the ties, either of kinship or of covenant!

are your brethren in religion. (In this way)
We explain the Aydt (proofs, evidences,

12. But if they violate their oaths after
their covenant, and attack your religion with
disapproval and criticism, then fight (you) the
leaders of disbelief (chiefs of Quraish pagans
of Makkah) - for surely their oaths are
nothing to them - so that they may stop (evil
actions).
13. Will you not fight a people who have
violated their oaths (pagans ofMakkah), and
intended to expel the Messenger while they
did attack you first? Do you fear them? Allah
has more right that you should fear Him if
you are believers.
14. Fight against them so that Allah will
punish them by your hands and disgrace them
and give you victory over them and heal the
breasts of a believing people,
15. And remove the anger of their
(believers') hearts. Allah accepts the
repentance of whom He wills. Allah is AllKnowing, All-Wise.
16. Do you think that you shall be left

among you who have striven hard and fought
and have not taken Walijah [(Bitdnah helpers, advisors and consultants from
disbelievers, pagans.) giving openly to them
their secrets] besides Allah, and His
Messenger, and the believers. Allah is WellAcquainted with what you do.
17. It is not for
the Mushrikun
(polytheists, idolaters, pagans, disbelievers in
the Oneness of Allah), to maintain the
Mosques of Allah (i.e. to pray and worship
Allah therein, to look after their cleanliness

admit him to Paradise, no matter whether he fights in AIIAh's Cause or remains in the land
where he is born." The people said, "O Allah's Messenger! Shall we acquaint the people
with this good news?" He said, "Paradise has one hundred grades which Allah has reserved
for the Mujahidim who fight in His Cause, and the distance between each of two grades is
like the distance between the heaven and the earth. So, when you ask Allah (for
something), ask for Al-Firdaus which is the riiddle and highest part of Paradise." [the
subnarrator added, "I think the Prophet ~ J ..,i; .ii 1 .fa also said, 'Above it (i.e. Al-Firdaus) is
the Throne of the Most Gracious (i.e. AIIAh), and from it gushes forth the rivers of Paradise]."

me, and whom I cannot provide with means of conveyance, I would certainly never remain
behind any Sariya (army unit) going out for Jihad in Allah's Cause. By Him in Whose Hand

then get martyred and then come back to life again, and then get martyred and then come
back to life again, and then get martyred." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.54).

Allah is twelve months (in a year), so was it
ordained by Allah on the Day when He
created the heavens and the earth; ofthem
four are Sacred (i.e. the I st, the 7th, the 11 th
and the 12th months of the lslfunic calendar).
That is the right religion, so wrong not
yourselves therein, and fight against the

disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah)

collectively. But know that Allah is with
those who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious - See
V.2:2).

37. The postponing (ofa Sacred Month) is
indeed an addition to disbelief: thereby the
disbelievers are led astray, for they make it
lawful one year and forbid it another year in
order to adjust the number of months
forbidden by Allah, and make such forbidden
ones lawful. The evil of their deeds is made
fair-seeming to them. And Allah guides not
the people who disbelieve.

with you, that when you are asked to march
forth in the Cause of Allah (i.e. Jihad) you
cling heavily to the earth? Are you pleased
with the life of this world rather than the
Hereafter? But little is the enjoyment of the
life of this world as compared to the

Him at all, and Allah is Able to do all things.

His Sakinah (calmness, tranquillity, peace) upon
him, and strengthened him with forces (angels)
which you saw not, and made the word of those
who disbelieved the lowermost, while the Word
of Allah that became the uppermost; and Allah is
All-Mighty, All-Wise.
41. March forth, whether you are light
(being healthy, young and wealthy) or heavy
(being ill, old and poor), and strive hard with
your wealth and your lives in the Cause of
Allah. This is better for you, if you but knew.
42. Had it been a near gain (booty in front
of them) and an easy journey, they would
have followed you, but the distance (Tabuk

certainly, they would have made some
preparation for it; but Allah was averse to
their being sent forth, so He made them lag
behind, and it was said (to them), "Sit you
among those who sit (at home)."
47. Had they marched out with you, they
would have added to you nothing except
disorder, and they would have hurried about
in your midst (spreading corruption) and
sowing sedition among you - and there are
some among you who would have listened to
them. And Allah is the All-Knower of the

48. Verily, they had plotted sedition

the truth (victory) came and the Decree of
Allah (His religion, Islam) became manifest

not to As-Sa/at (the prayer) except in a lazy
state,111 and that they offer not contnbutions but
unwillingly.
55. So let not their wealth nor their children
amaze you (0 Muhammad 4# .11 ,fa

with these things in the life of this world,
and that their souls shall depart (die) while
they are disbelievers.

truly of you while they are not of you, but
they are a people (hypocrites) who are afraid
(that you may kill them).
57. Should they find a refuge, or caves, or
a place of concealment, they would turn
straightway thereto with a swift rush.

58. And of them are some who accuse you

Al-Mastikin111 (the poor) and those employed

of those who have been inclined (towards

And Allah is All-Knower, All-Wise.

and say: "He is (lending his) ear (to every

you; he believes in Allah, has faith in the
believers, and is a mercy to those of you who
believe." But those who annoy Allah's
Messenger (Muhammad r-1- J ~ .iii I J-P) will
have a painful torment. [See V.33:57]
62. They swear by Allah to you (Muslims)
in order to please you, but it is more fitting
that they

66. Make no excuse; you disbelieved
after you had believed. If We pardon some of
you, We will punish others amongst you
because they were Mujrimun (disbelievers,
polytheists, sinners, criminals.).

Al-Munkar (i.e. disbelief and polytheism of
all kinds and all that Islam has forbidden),
and forbid (people) from Al-Ma 'ruf (i.e.
Islamic Monotheism and all that Islam orders
one to do), and they close their hands [from
giving (spending in Allah's Cause) alms.].
They have forgotten Allah, so He has
forgotten them. Verily, the hypocrites are the
Fdsiqun (rebellious, disobedient to Allah).
68. Allah has promised the hypocrites
- men and women - and the disbelievers,
the Fire of Hell; therein shall they abide. It
will suffice them. Allah has cursed them and
for them is the lasting torment.

69. Like those before you: they were
mightier than you in power, and more

and all that lslfun orders one to do), and

polytheism and disbelief of all kinds, and all
that Islfun has forbidden); they perform AsSa/at (Jqdmat-as-Sa/at), and give the Zakat,
and obey Allah and His Messenger. Allah
will have His Mercy on them. Surely Allah is
All-Mighty, All-Wise.
72. Allah has promised the believers men and women, - Gardens under which
rivers flow to dwell therein forever, and
beautiful mansions in Gardens of 'Adn (Eden
Paradise). But the greatest bliss is the Good
Pleasure of Allah. That is the supreme
success.
73. 0 Prophet (Muhammad r-1-, ~ 11 ._..L..)!
Strive hard against the disbelievers and the
hypocrites, and be harsh against them, their
abode is Hell, - and worst indeed is that

74. They swear by Allah that they said

of disbelief, and they disbelieved after
accepting Islfun, and they resolved that

76. Then when He gave them of His

pay the Sadaqdh (Zakdt or voluntary

marriage, and has not done so yet, should not accompany me; nor should a man who
has built a house but has not completed its roof; nor a man who has sheep or shecamels and is waiting for the birth of their young ones.' So, the Prophet carried out
the expedition and when he reached that town at the time or nearly at the time of the
'Asr prayer, he said to the sun,
sun! You are under Allah's Order and I am under
Allah's Order. O Allah! Stop it (i.e. the sun) from setting.' It was stopped till Allah
made him victorious. Then he collected the booty and the fire came to burn it, but it
did not burn it*. He said (to his men), 'Some of you have stolen something from the
booty. So one man from every tribe should give me a Bai'a (pledge) by shaking hands
with me.' (They did so and) the hand of a man got stuck in the hand of their Prophet.
Then that Prophet said (to the man), 'The theft has been committed by your people.
So all the persons of your tribe should give me the Bai'a (pledge) by shaking hands
with me.' The hands of two or three men got stuck in the hand of their Prophet and he
said, 'You have committed the theft.' Then they brought a head of gold like the head

Promise of Allah is true. It is He Who begins
the creation and then will repeat it, that He
may reward with justice those who believed

But those who disbelieved will have a drink
of boiling fluids and painful torment because

5. It is He Who made the sun a shining

11. And were Allah to hasten for mankind
the evil (they invoke for themselves and for
their children. while in a state of anger) as He
hastens for them the good (they invoke) then
they would have been ruined. So We leave
those who expect not their meeting with Us,
in their trespasses, wandering blindly in
distraction. (Tafsir At-Tabari)
12. And when harm touches man, he
invokes Us, lying on his side, or sitting or
standing. But when We have removed his
harm from him, he passes on as if he had
never invoked Us for a harm that touched
him! Thus it is made fair-seeming to the
Musrifun 111 that which they used to do.

13. And indeed, We destroyed generations
before you when they did wrong, while their
Messengers came to them with clear proofs,
but they were not such as to believe! Thus do
We requite the people who are Mujrimun
(disbelievers, polytheists, sinners, criminals).
14. Then We made you successors after
them, generations after generations in the
land, that We might see how you would work.
15. And when Our clear Verses are recited
unto them, those who hope not for their
meeting with Us, say: "Bring us a Qur'an
other than this, or change it." Say (0
Muhammad r!-J ~ .ii I J--,): "It is not for me to
change it on my own accord; I only follow that
which is revealed unto me. Verily, I fear the
111 (V.10: 12) MusrifOn: Those who belied Allah and His Prophets, and transgressed Allah's
limits by committing all kinds of crimes and sins.

Allah had so willed, I should not have recited
it to you nor would He have made it known to
you. Verily, I have stayed amongst you a life
time before this. Have you then no sense?"
17. So who does more wrong than he who
forges a lie against Allah or denies His Ayat
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.)? Surely, the Mujrimun
(criminals,
sinners,
disbelievers
and
polytheists) will never be successful!
18. And they worship besides Allah things
that harm them not, nor profit them, and they
say: "These are our intercessors with Allah."
Say: "Do you inform Allah of that which He
knows not in the heavens and on the earth?"
Glorified and Exalted is He above all that
which they associate as partners (with Him)!
19. Mankind were but one community
(i.e. on one religion - Islamic Monotheism),
then they differed (later); and had not it been
for a Word that went forth before from your
Lord, it would have been settled between
them regarding what they differed111 •

20. And they say: "How is it that not a
sign is sent down on him from his Lord?"
Say: "The Unseen belongs to Allah Alone, so
wait you, verily, I am with you among those
who wait (for Allah's Judgement)."
21. And when We let mankind taste mercy
after some adversity has afflicted them,
behold! they take to plotting against Our Ayat

revelations, etc.)! Say: "Allah is more Swift
111 (V.10:19) Narrated Abu Hurairah..., .iii, .,..J: The Prophet ,-LJ ~ .iii 1 ~ said, "Every child

(angels) record all of that which you plot. 1
22. He it is Who enables you to travel
through land and sea, till when you are in the
ships, and they sail with them with a
favourable wind, and they are glad therein,
then comes a stormy wind and the waves
come to them from all sides, and they think
that they are encircled therein. Then they
invoke Allah, making their Faith pure for Him
Alone, (saying): "If You (Allah) deliver us
from this, we shall truly be of the grateful." 121

23. But when He delivers them, behold!
they rebel (disobey Allah) in the earth
wrongfully. 0 mankind! Your rebellion
(disobedience to Allah) is only against your
ownselves, - a brief enjoyment of this worldly
life, then (in the end) unto Us is your return,
and We shall inform you of that which you
used to do.
24. Verily, the likeness of (this) worldly
life is as the water (rain) which We send
down from the sky; so by it arises the
intermingled produce of the earth ofwhich
men and cattle eat: until when the earth is
clad in its adornments and is beautified, and
its people think that they have all the powers
of disposal over it, Our Command reaches it
by night or by day and We make it like a
clean-mown harvest, as if it had not
flourished yesterday! Thus do We explain the
Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons,
signs, revelations, laws, etc.) in detail for the
people who reflect.

26. For those who have done good is the
best (reward, i.e. Paradise) and even more

Countenance of Allah u')4- ~ ) . Neither
darkness nor dust nor any humiliating
disgrace shall cover their faces. They are the
dwellers of Paradise, they will abide therein
forever.

27. And those who have earned evil
deeds, the recompense of an evil deed is the
like thereof, and humiliating disgrace will
cover them (their faces). No defender will
they have from Allah. Their faces will be
covered as it were with pieces from the
darkness of night. They are the dwellers of
the Fire, they will abide therein forever.
28. And the Day whereon We shall gather
them all together, then We shall say to those
who did set partners in worship with Us:
"Stop at your place! You and your partners
(whom you had worshipped in the worldly
life)." then We shall separate them, and their
(Allah's so-called) partners shall say: "It was
not us that you used to worship."
29. "So sufficient is Allah as a witness
between us and you that we indeed knew
nothing of your worship ofus."
30. There! Every person will know
(exactly) what he had earned before and they
will be brought back to Allah, their rightful
Mau/a {Lord), and their invented false deities
will vanish from them.
31. Say (0 Muhammad r1-J ~.ii, _,..J.-,):
"Who provides for you from the sky and the

who brings out the living from the dead and
brings out the dead from the living? And who

32. Such is Allah, your Lord in truth. So
after the truth, what else can there be, save
error? How then are you turned away?
33. Thus is the Word of your Lord
justified against those who rebel (disobey
Allah) that they will not believe (in the
Oneness of Allah and in Muhammad ..ii , J..o

34. Say: "Is there of your (Allah'
called) partners one that originates the
creation and then repeats it?" Say: "Allah
originates the creation and then He repeats it.
Then how are you deluded away (from the
truth)?"
35. Say: "Is there of your (Allah's socalled) partners one that guides to the truth?"
Say: "It is Allah Who guides to the truth. Is
then He Who guides to the truth more worthy
to be followed, or he who finds not guidance
(himself) unless he is guided? Then, what is
the matter with you? How judge you?"
36. And most of them follow nothing but
conjecture. Certainly, conjecture can be ofno
avail against the truth. Surely, Allah is
All-Aware of what they do.

37. And this Qur'an is not such as could
ever be produced by other than Allah (Lord
of the heavens and the earth) but it is a
confirmation of (the revelation)111 which was
before it [i.e. the Taurat (Torah), and the
lnjeel (Gospel)], and a full explanation of the
Book (i.e. laws, decreed for mankind) wherein there is no doubt - from the
Lord of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinn, and all
that exists).

C1l r,J.10:37) Narrated Abu Hurairah ~ ..ii 1 .r1';: The Prophet ,1-:J ~ .Ji I J- said, "There was
no Prophet among the Prophets but was given miracles because of which people had
security or had belief, but what I have been given is the Divine Revelation which AIIAh has
revealed to me. So I hope that my followers will be more than those of any other Prophet on
the Day of Resurrection." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.9, Hadith No.379).

39. Nay, they have belied the knowledge
whereof they could not comprehend and what
has not yet been fulfilled (i.e. their
punishment). Thus those before them did
belie. Then see what was the end of the
Zalimun (polytheists and wrong-doers)!
40. And of them there are some who
believe therein; and of them there are some
who believe not therein, and your Lord is AllAware of the Mufsidun (evil-doers, liars).

41. And if they belie you, say: "For me
are my deeds and for you are your deeds!
You are innocent of what I do, and I am
innocent of what you do!"
42. And among them are some who listen
to you, but can you make the deaf to hear even though they apprehend not?

43. And among them are some who look
at you, but can you guide the blind - even
though they see not?
44. Truly! Allah wrongs not mankind in
aught; but mankind wrong themselves.
45. And on the Day when He shall gather
(resurrect) them together, (it will be) as if
they had not stayed (in the life of this world
and graves) but an hour of a day. They will
recognise each other. Ruined indeed will be

82. "And Alliih will establish and make
apparent the truth by His Words, however
much the Mujrimun ( criminals, disbelievers,
polytheists, sinners) may hate (it)."

83. But none believed in Musil (Moses)
except the offspring of his people, because of the
fear ofFir'aun (Pharaoh) and his chiefs, lest they
should persecute them; and verily, Fir'aun
(Pharaoh) was an arrogant tyrant on the earth, he
was indeed one of the Musrifon (polytheists,
sinners and transgressors, those who give up the
truth and follow the evil, and commit all kinds of
great sins).
84. And Musil {Moses) said: "O my
people! If you have believed in Allah, then
put your trust in Him if you are Muslims
(those who submit to Allah's Will)."
85. They said: "In Alliih we put our trust.
Our Lord! Make us not a trial for the folk
who are Zdlimun (polytheists and wrongdoers) (i.e. do not make them overpower us).

86. "And save us by Your Mercy from the
disbelieving folk."
87. And We revealed to Musil (Moses)
and his brother (saying): "Provide dwellings
for your people in Egypt, and make your
dwellings as places for your worship, and
perform As-Saldt (lqdmat-as-Saldt), and give
glad tidings to the believers."

88. And Musil (Moses) said: "Our Lord!
You have indeed bestowed on Fir'aun
(Pharaoh) and his chiefs splendour and wealth
in the life of this world, our Lord! that they
may lead men astray from Your Path. Our
Lord! Destroy their wealth, and harden their
hearts, so that they will not believe until they

Straight Way (i.e. keep on doing good deeds
and preaching Allah's Message with
patience), and follow not the path ofthose
who know not (the truth i.e. to believe in the
Oneness of Allah, and also to believe in the
Reward of Allah: Paradise)."
90. And We took the Children of Israel
across the sea, and Fir'aun (Pharaoh) with his
hosts followed them in oppression and
enmity, till when drowning overtook him, he
said: "I believe that none has the right to be

19. Those who hinder (others) from the

a crookedness therein, while they are
disbelievers in the Hereafter.

20. By no means will they escape (from
Allah's Torment) on earth, nor have they
protectors besides Allah! Their torment will
be doubled! They could not bear to hear (the
preachers of the truth) and they used not to

(Hisham, a subnarrator said, reporting the Prophet's words), "The believer will come near
(his Lord) till his Lord covers him with His Screen and makes him confess his sins. (Allah
will ask him). 'Do you know (that you did) such-and-such a sin.' He will say twice, 'Yes, I
know I did commit those sins.' Then Allah will say, 'I did screen your sins in the world and I
forgive them for you today.' Then the record of his good deeds will be folded up [i.e. the
record (Book) of his good deeds will be given to him]. As for the others or the disbelievers,

Verily, 'Ad
disbelieved in their Lord. So away with 'Ad,

61. And to Thamud (people We sent) their
brother Siilih. He said: "O my people!
Worship Allah: you have no other ildh (god)
but Him. He brought you forth from the earth
and settled you therein, then ask forgiveness
of Him and tum to Him in repentance.
Certainly, my Lord is Near (to all by His
Knowledge), Responsive."

62. They said: "O Siilih ! You have been
among us as a figure of good hope ( and we
wished for you to be our chief) till this [new
thing which you have brought that we leave
our gods and worship your God (Allah)
Alone]! Do you (now) forbid us the worship
of what our fathers have worshipped? But we
are really in grave doubt as to that to which
you invite us (monotheism)."
63. He said: "O my people! Tell me, if I
have a clear proof from my Lord, and there has
come to me a Mercy (Prophethood) from Him,
who then can help me against Allah, if I were to
disobey Him? Then you increase me not but in
loss.

64. "And O my people! This she-camel of
Allah is a sign to you, so leave her to feed
(graze) in Allah's land, and touch her not with
evil, lest a near torment should seize you."
65. But they killed her. So he said: "Enjoy
yourselves in your homes for three days. This
is a promise (i.e. a threat) that will not be
belied."
66. So when Our Commandment came,
We saved Siilih and those who believed with
him by a Mercy from Us, and from the
disgrace of that Day. Verily, your Lord - He

69. And
verily,
there came Our
messengers to Ibrahim (Abraham) with glad
tidings.They said: Salam (greetings or peace!)
He answered, Salam (greetings or peace!) and
he hastened to entertain them with a roasted
calf.
70. But when he saw their hands went not
towards it (the meal), he mistrusted them, and
conceived a fear of them. They said: "Fear
not, we have been sent against the people of
Lilt (Lot)."

71. And his wife was standing (there), and
she laughed [either, because the messengers
did not eat their food or for being glad for the
destruction of the people ofLOt (Lot)]. But
We gave her glad tidings oflshiiq (Isaac), and
after Ishaq, ofYa'qOb (Jacob).
72. She said (in astonishment): "Woe unto
me! Shall I bear a child while I am an old
woman, 111 and here is my husband an old

Decree of Allah? The Mercy of Allah and His
Blessings be on you, 0 the family [oflbrahim

All-Praiseworthy, All-Glorious."

from (the mind of) Ibrahim (Abraham), and

Indeed, the Commandment of your Lord has

for them which cannot be turned back."

Lilt (Lot), he was grieved on account of them
and felt himself straitened for them (lest the
town people should approach them to commit
sodomy with them). He said: "This is a
distressful day."
78. And his people came rushing towards

crimes (sodomy), he said: "O my people!
Here are my daughters (i.e. the women of the

"What good news! Here is a boy." So they

33. He said:"O my Lord! Prison is dearer
to me than that to which they invite me.
Unless You turn away their plot from me, I
will feel inclined towards them and be one (of
those who commit sin and deserve blame or
those who do deeds) of the ignorant."
34. So his Lord answered his invocation
and turned away from him their plot. Verily,
He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.

35. Then it occurred to them, after they
had seen the proofs (of his innocence), to
imprison him for a time.
36. And there entered with him two young
men in the prison. One of them said: "Verily,
I saw myself (in a dream) pressing wine." The
other said: "Verily, I saw myself (in a dream)
carrying bread on my head and birds were
eating thereof." (They said): "Inform us of the
interpretation of this. Verily, we think you are
one of the Muhsinun (doers of good)."
37. He said: "No food will come to you
(in wakefulness or in dream) as your
provision, but I will inform (in wakefulness)
its interpretation before it (the food) comes.
This is of that which my Lord has taught me.
Verily, I have abandoned the religion ofa
people that believe not in Allfill and are
disbelievers in the Hereafter (i.e. the
Kan' anyyun of Egypt who were polytheists
and used to worship sun and other false

many different lords (gods) better or Allfill,

40. "You do not worship besides Him but
only names which you have named (forged)

has sent down no authority. The command (or
the judgement) is for none but Allfill. He has
commanded that you worship none but Him

and as for the other, he will be crucified and
birds will eat from his head. Thus is the case

42. And he said to the one whom he knew
to be saved: "Mention me to your lord (i.e.
your king, so as to get me out of the prison)."
But Shaittin (Satan) made him forget to
mention it to his lord [or Satan made Yusuf
(Joseph) to forget the remembrance of his
Lord (Allfill) as to ask for His Help, instead of
others]. So [Yusuf(Joseph)] stayed in prison

to put their money (with which they had
bought the corn) into their bags, so that they
might know it when they go back to their

69. And when they went in before Yusuf
(Joseph), he took his brother (Benjamin) to
himself and said: "Verily!! am your brother,
so grieve not for what they used to do."

70. So when he had furnished them forth
with their provisions, he put the (golden)
bowl in his brother's bag. Then a crier cried:
('I. 12:67).
a) Narrated lbn 'Abbas ~ .ii, ..r-1'~: Allah's Messenger r1--J ~ .ii, ~ said, "Seventy
thousand people of my followers will enter Paradise without account, and they are those
who do not practise Ar-Ruqyah* and do not see an evil omen in things, and put their trust in
their Lord." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Hadith No. 479)
• Ar-Ruqyah: See the glossary.
b) Narrated Abu Hurairah w .ii, ._rJ,/ The Prophet ~J ~ .ii 1 ,)-,, said, "An Israeli man asked
another Israeli to lend him one thousand dinars. The second man required witnesses. The
former replied, 'Allah is Sufficient as a witness.' The second said, 'I want a surety.' The
former replied, 'Allah is Sufficient as a Surety.' The second said, 'You are right' and lent
him the money for a certain period. The debtor went across the sea. When he finished his
job, he searched for a conveyance so that he might reach in time for the repayment of the
debt, but he could not find any. So, he took a piece of wood and made a hole in it, inserted
in it one thousand dinars and a letter to the lender and then closed (i.e. sealed) the hole
tightly. He took the piece of wood to the sea and said. 'O Allah! You know well that I took a
loan of one thousand dinars from so-and-so. He demanded a surety from me but I told him
that Allah's Guarantee was sufficient and he accepted Your Guarantee. He then asked for a
witness and I told him that Allah was sufficient as a Witness, and he accepted You as a
Witness. No doubt, I have tried hard to find a conveyance so that I could pay his money
back but could not find, so I hand over this money to You.' Saying that, he threw the piece
of wood into the sea till it went out far into it, and then he went away. Meanwhile he started
searching for a conveyance in order to reach the creditor's country. One day the lender
came out of his house to see whether a ship had arrived bringing his money, and all of a
sudden he saw the piece of wood (in which his money had been deposited). He took it
home to use for fire. When he sawed it, he found his money and the letter inside it. Shortly
after that, the debtor came bringing one thousand dinars to him and said, 'By Allah, I had
been trying hard to get a boat so that I could bring you your money, but failed to get one
before the one I have come by.' The lender asked, 'Have you sent something to me?' The
debtor replied, 'I have told you I could not get a boat other than the one I have come by.'
The lender said, 'Allah has delivered on your behalf the money you sent in the piece of
wood. So, you may keep your one thousand dinars and depart guided on the Right Path.' •

Then he brought it out of his brother's bag.
Thus did We plan for Yusuf (Joseph). He
could not take his brother by the law of the

(So Allah made the brothers to bind themselves

said: "If he steals, there was a brother of his

But these things did Yusuf (Joseph) keep in
himself, revealing not the secrets to them. He
said (within himself): "You are in worst case,

for him); so take one of us in his place.
Indeed we think that you are one of the

take anyone but him with whom we found our
property. Indeed (ifwe did so), we should be

80. So, when they despaired of him, they
held a conference in private. The eldest
among them said: "Know you not that your
father did take an oath from you in Allah's
Name, and before this you did fail in your
duty with Yusuf (Joseph)? Therefore I will
not leave this land until my father permits me,
or Allah decides my case (by releasing
Benjamin) and He is the Best of the judges.

me). May be Allah will bring them (back) all
to me. Truly He! Only He is All-Knowing,

said: "Alas, my grief for Yusuf (Joseph)!"
And he lost his sight because of the sorrow
that he was suppressing.

never give up hope of Allah's Mercy.
Certainly no one despairs of Allah's Mercy,
except the people who disbelieve."
88. Then, when they entered unto him
[YOsuf (Joseph)], they said: "O ruler of the
land! A hard time has hit us and our family,
and we have brought but poor capital, so pay
us full measure and be charitable to us. Truly,
Allah does reward the charitable."

89. He said: "Do you know what you did

you were ignorant?"
90. They said: "Are you indeed YOsuf

and this is my brother (Benjamin). Allah has
indeed been gracious to us. Verily, he who
fears Allah with obedience to Him (by
abstaining from sins and evil deeds, and by

2. Allah is He Who raised the heavens
without any pillars that you can see. Then, He
rose above (lstawa) the Throne (really in a
manner that suits His Majesty). He has
subjected the sun and the moon (to continue
going round), each running (its course) for a
term appointed. He manages and regulates all
affairs; He explains the Aydt (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations,
etc.) in detail, that you may believe with
certainty in the meeting with your Lord.
3. And it is He Who spread out the earth,
and placed therein finn mountains and rivers
and of every kind of fruits He made Zawjain
lthnain (two in pairs - may mean two kinds
or it may mean: of two varieties, e.g. black
and white, sweet and sour, small and big). He
brings the night as a cover over the day.
Verily, in these things, there are Aydt (proofs,
evidences, lessons, signs, etc.) for people who
reflect.
4. And in the earth are neighbouring
tracts, and gardens of vines, and green crops
(fields), and date-palms, growing into two or
three from a single stem root, or otherwise
(one stem root for every palm), watered with
the same water; yet some of them We make
more excellent than others to eat. Verily, in
these things there are Aydt (proofs, evidences,
lessons, signs) for the people who understand.

5. And if you (0 Muhammad ~ .ii, _,L..

your message of Islamic Monotheism and
have taken besides Allah others for worship
who can neither harm nor benefit), then
wondrous is their saying: "When we are dust,
shall we indeed then be (raised) in a new
creation?" They are those who disbelieved in
their Lord! They are those who will have iron
chains tying their hands to their necks. They
will be the dwellers of the Fire to abide therein.
6. They ask you to hasten the evil before
the
good,
while (many) exemplary
punishments have indeed occurred before
them. But verily, your Lord is full of
Forgiveness for mankind inspite of their
wrong-doing. And verily, your Lord is (also)
Severe in punishment.
7. And the disbelievers say: "Why is not a sign
sent down to him from his Lord?" You are only a
wamer, and to every people there is a guide.

8. Allah knows what every female bears,
and by how much the wombs fall short (of
their time or number) or exceed. Everything
with Him is in (due) proportion.
9. All-Knower of the Unseen and the seen,
the Most Great, the Most High.

10. It is the same (to Him) whether any of
you conceal his speech or declares it openly,
whether he be hid by night or goes forth
freely by day.
11. For him (each person), there are
angels in succession, before and behind
him. 111 They guard him by the Command of
Allah. Verily! Allah will not change the
(good) condition of a people as long as they
do not change their state (of goodness)
themselves (by committing sins and by being
ungrateful and disobedient to Allah). But

12. It is He Who shows you the lightning,
as a fear (for travellers) and as a hope (for
those who wait for rain). And it is He Who
brings up (or originates) the clouds, heavy
(with water).
13. And Ar-Ra 'd 111 (thunder) glorifies and
praises Him, and so do the angels because of
His Awe. He sends the thunderbolts, and
therewith He strikes whom He wills, yet they
(disbelievers) dispute about Allah. And He is
Mighty in strength and Severe in punishment.
14. For Him (Allah, Alone) is the Word of
Truth (i.e. none has the right to be
worshipped but Allah). And those whom they
(polytheists and disbelievers) invoke, answer
them no more than one who stretches forth his
hand (at the edge of a deep well) for water to
reach his mouth, but it reaches him not; and
the invocation of the disbelievers is nothing
but an error (i.e. ofno use).

which mountains could be moved (from their
places), or the earth could be cloven asunder,
or the dead could be made to speak (it would
not have been other than this Qur'iin). But the
decision of all things is certainly with Allah.
Have not then those who believed yet known
that had Allah willed, He could have guided
all mankind? And a disaster will not cease to
strike those who disbelieved because of their
[ii 0/.13:28) The superiority of Dhikr Allah .:u, i-5:, [remembering Allah (i.e. glorifying and
praising Him.)]
a) Narrated Abu Musa ..., .:u, ~ J : The Prophet ~J ~ .:ii, ._;.., said, "The example of the one
who remembers (glorifies the Praises of) his Lord, (Allah) in comparison to the one who
does not remember (glorify the Praises of) his Lord, is that of a living creature compared to
a dead one." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.416).
b) Narrated Abu Hurairah <...\.o .:u, ._,.;,J : Allah's Messenger r!--J ~ .:u, ,,L, said, "Whoever
says, Subhan Al/ahi wa bihamdihi, one hundred times a day, will be forgiven all his sins
even if they were as much as the foam of the sea." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith
No.414).
c) Narrated Abu Hurairah ..., .:u 1 ~ ; : Allah's Messenger r!--J ~ .:u, ._;.., said, "Whoever says:
La ilaha illal/ahu wahdahO la sharika lahO, lahul-mulku wa lahul-hamdu wa Huwa 'ala kulli

that day till night, and nobody will be able to do a better deed except the one who does
more than he." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.8, Hadith No.412).
*None has the right to be worshipped but Allah (Alone) Who has no partner; to Him belongs the

close to their homes, until the Promise of
Allah comes to pass. Certainly, Allah breaks
not His Promise.
32. And indeed (many) Messengers were
mocked at before you (0 Muhammad .:ii I J..o
r!--J ~). but I granted respite to those who
disbelieved, and finally I punished them.
Then how (terrible) was My punishment!
33. Is then He (Allah) Who takes charge
(guards, maintains, provides) of every person
and knows all that he has earned (like any
other deities who know nothing)? Yet, they
ascribe partners to Allah. Say: "Name them!
Is it that you will inform Him of something
He knows not in the earth or is it Gust) a
show of false words." Nay! To those who
is made
disbelieved,
their
plotting
fairseeming, and they have been hindered
from the Right Path; and whom Allah sends
astray, for him there is no guide.

34. For them is a torment in the life of this
world, and certainly, harder is the torment of
the Hereafter. And they have no Wdq
(defender or protector) against Allah.
35. The description of the Paradise which
the Muttaqun (the pious - See V.2:2) have
been promised: Underneath it rivers flow, its
provision is eternal and so is its shade; this is
the end (final destination) of the Muttaqun

down to be a judgement of authority in
Arabic. Were you (0 Muhammad ~ .ii 1 ~
r,l--J) to follow their (vain) desires after the
knowledge which has come to you, then you
will not have any Wali (protector) or Wdq

38. And indeed We sent Messengers

made for them wives and offspring. And it
was not for a Messenger to bring a sign
except by Allah's Leave. (For) every matter
there is a Decree (from Allah). [Tafsir

39. Allah blots out what He wills and
confirms (what He wills). And with Him is
the Mother of the Book (Al-lauh Al-Mahfuz)
40. Whether We show you (0 Muhammad

the land ( of the disbelievers, by giving it to
the believers, in war victories) from its
outlying borders. And Allah judges, there is
none to put back His Judgement and He is
Swift at reckoning.
42. And verily, those before them did
devise plots, but all planning is Allah's. He
knows what every person earns, and the
disbelievers will know who gets the good end
(final destination).

43. And those who disbelieved, say: "You

between me and you is Allah and those too

[These letters are one of the miracles of

(This is) a Book which We have revealed
unto you (0 Muhammad rl--J ~ .ii 1..,.i..) in
order that you might lead mankind out of
darkness (of disbelief and polytheism) into
light (of belief in the Oneness of Allfill and
Islfunic Monotheism) by their Lord's Leave
to the Path of the All-Mighty, the Owner of

2. Allfill to Whom belongs all that is in the

3. Those who prefer the life of this world
to the Hereafter, and hinder (men) from the
Path of Allfill (i.e.Islfun) and seek
crookedness therein - they are far astray.
4. And We sent not a Messenger except
with the language of his people, in order that
he might make (the Message) clear for them.
Then Allah misleads whom He wills and
guides whom He wills. And He is the
All-Mighty, the All-Wise.

proclaimed: "If you give thanks (by accepting

give you more (of My Blessings); but if you
are thankless (i.e. disbelievers), verily My

8. And Musa (Moses) said: "If you
disbelieve, you and all on earth together, then
verily Allah is Rich (Free of all needs),
Owner of all Praise."

9. Has not the news reached you, of those
before you, the people of Nuh (Noah), and
'Ad, and Thamud? And those after them?
None knows them but Allah. To them came
their Messengers with clear proofs, but they
put their hands in their mouths (biting them
from anger) and said: "Verily, we disbelieve
in that with which you have been sent, and we
are really in grave doubt as to that to which
you invite us (i.e. Islamic Monotheism)."
10. Their Messengers said: "What! Can
there be a doubt about Allah, the Creator of
the heavens and the earth? He calls you (to
Monotheism and to be obedient to Allah) that
He may forgive you of your sins and give you
respite for a term appointed." They said:
"You are no more than human beings like us!
You wish to turn us away from what our
fathers used to worship. Then bring us a clear
authority (i.e. a clear proof of what you say)."
11. Their Messengers said to them: "We
are no more than human beings like you, but
Allah bestows His Grace to whom He wills of
His slaves. It is not ours to bring you an
authority (proof) except by the Permission of
Allah. And in Allah (Alone) let the believers

patience all the hurt you may cause us, and in

13. And those who disbelieved, said to
their Messengers: "Surely, we shall drive you
out of our land, or you shall return to our
religion." So their Lord revealed to them:
"Truly, We shall destroy the Zd/imun
(polytheists, disbelievers and wrong-doers).

14. "And indeed, We shall make you dwell
in the land after them. This is for him who fears
standing before Me (on the Day of Resurrection
or fears My punishment) and also fears My
threat."
15. And they (the Messengers) sought
victory and help [from their Lord (Allah)];
and every obstinate, arrogant dictator (who
refuses to believe in the Oneness of Allah)
was brought to a complete loss and
destruction.

16. In front of him (every obstinate,
arrogant dictator) is Hell, and he will be made
to drink boiling, festering water.
17. He will sip it unwillingly, and he will
find a great difficulty to swallow it down his
throat 111 ; and death will come to him from
every side, yet he will not die and in front of
him, will be a great torment.
18. The parable of those who disbelieved
in their Lord is that their works are as ashes,
on which the wind blows furiously on a
stormy day; they shall not be able to get aught
of what they have earned. That is the straying,
far away (from the Right Path).
19. Do you not see that Allah has created
the heavens and the earth with truth?If He

20. And for Allah that is not hard or

21. And they all shall appear before Allah
(on the Day of Resurrection); then the weak
will say to those who were arrogant (chiefs):
"Verily, we were following you; can you avail
us anything against Allah's Torment?" They
will say: "Had Allah guided us, we would
have guided you. It makes no difference to us
(now) whether we rage, or bear (these
torments) with patience; there is no place of
refuge for us."

22. And Shaitan (Satan) will say when the
matter has been decided: "Verily, Allah
promised you a promise of truth. And I too
promised you, but I betrayed you. I had no
authority over you except that I called you,
and you responded to me. So blame me not,
but blame yourselves. I cannot help you, nor
can you help me. I deny your former act in
associating me (Satan) as a partner with Allah
(by obeying me in the life of the world).
Verily, there is a painful torment for the
Zalimiin (polytheists and wrong-doers)."

C1l (V.14:37). The Story of the building of the Ka'bah at Makkah:
Narrated lbn 'Abbas ~ .ii 1 ~;: [On the authority of the Prophet r-1-'.J .,is .ii 1 ~ (See Fath
Al-Bari, Vol. 7, Page 210)]. The first lady to use a girdle was the mother of lsma'il
(Ishmael). She used a girdle so that she might hide her tracks from Sarah.* Ibrahim
(Abraham) brought her and her son lsma'il (Ishmael) while she used to nurse him at her
breast, near the Ka'bah under a tree on the spot of Zamzam, at the highest place in the
mosque. During those days there was nobody in Makkah, nor was there any water. So he
made them sit over there and placed near them a leather bag containing some dates, and a
small water-skin containing some water, and set out homeward. lsma'il's (Ishmael) mother
followed him saying, "O Ibrahim (Abraham)! Where are you going, leaving us in this valley
where there is no person whose company we may enjoy, nor is there anything (to enjoy)?"
She repeated that to him many times, but he did not look back at her. Then she asked him,
"Has Allah ordered you to do so?" He said, "Yes." She said, "Then He will not neglect us,"
and returned while Ibrahim (Abraham) proceeded onwards, and on reaching the Thaniyyah
where they could not see him, he faced the Ka'bah, and raising both hands invoked Allah
saying the following supplication:
'O our Lord! I have made some of my offspring to dwell in an uncultivable valley by Your
Sacred House (the Ka'bah at Makkah); in order, 0 our Lord, that they may perform
As-Sa/flt (lqflmat-as-Salat). So fill some hearts among men with love towards them, and (0
Allah) provide them with fruits, so that they may give thanks.' (V.14:37)
lsma'il's (Ishmael) mother went on suckling lsma'il (Ishmael) and drinking from the water
(she had). When the water in the water-skin had all been used up, she became thirsty and
her child also became thirsty. She started looking at him [i.e. lsma'il (Ishmael)) tossing in
agony; she left him, for she could not endure looking at him, and found that the mountain of
As-Safa was the nearest mountain to her on that land. She stood on it and started looking
at the valley keenly so that she might see somebody, but she could not see anybody. Then
she descended from As-Safa and when she reached the valley, she tucked up her robe and
ran in the valley like a person in distress and trouble, till she crossed the valley and reached
AI-Marwah mountain where she stood and started looking, expecting to see somebody, but
she could not see anybody. She repeated that (running between As-Safa and AI-Marwah)
seven times." The Prophet r:1,-J ~ .ii 1 ~ said, "This is the source of the tradition of the
Sa'y (the going) of people between them (i.e. As-Safa and AI-Marwah). When she reached
AI-Marwah (for the last time) she heard a voice and she asked herself to be quiet and
(whoever you may be)! You
listened attentively. She heard the voice again and said,
have made me hear your voice; have you got something to help me?' And behold! She saw
an angel at the place of Zamzam, digging the earth with his heel (or his wing), till water
flowed from that place. She started to make something like a basin around it, using her
hands in this way and started filling her water-skin with water with her hands, and the water
was flowing out after she had scooped some of it.· The Prophet ,.LJ <.!L: .ii 1 ~ added, "May
Allah bestow mercy on lsma'il's (Ishmael) mother! Had she let the Zamzam (flow without
trying to control it) (or had she not scooped from that water) (to fill her water-skin), Zamzam
would have been a stream flowing on the surface of the earth.· The Prophet r-'J .,is .ii 1 ~
further added, "Then she drank (water) and suckled her child. The angel said to her, 'Don't
be afraid of being neglected, for this is the House of Allah which will be built by this boy and
his father, and Allah never neglects His people.' The House (i.e. Ka'bah) at that time was
on a high place resembling a hillock, and when torrents came, they flowed to its right and
left. She lived in that way till some people from the tribe of Jurhum or a family from Jurhum
passed by her and her child, as they (i.e. the Jurhum people) were coming through the way
of Kada'. They landed in the lower part of Makkah where they saw a bird that had the habit
of flying around water and not leaving it. They said, 'This bird must be flying around water,
though we know that there is no water in this valley.' They sent one or two messengers who
discovered the source of water, and returned to inform them of the water. So, they all came
(towards the water)." The Prophet r--"J <.!L: .ii 1 ~ added, "lsma'il's (Ishmael) mother was

·o

sitting near the water. They asked her, 'Do you allow us to stay with you?' She replied,
'Yes, but you will have no right to possess the water.' They agreed to that." The Prophet
r!--J ',!ls ..ii 1 ~ further said, "lsmA'il's (Ishmael) mother was pleased with the whole situation
as she used to love to enjoy the company of the people. So, they settled there, and later on
they sent for their families who came and settled with them so that some families became
permanent residents there. The child [i.e. lsmA'il (Ishmael)) grew up and learnt Arabic from
them and (his virtues) caused them to love and admire him as he grew up, and when he
reached the age of puberty they made him marry a woman from amongst them. After
lsma'il's (Ishmael) mother had died, Ibrahim (Abraham) came after lsma'il's (Ishmael)
marriage in order to see his family that he had left before, but he did not find lsma'il
(Ishmael) there. When he asked lsma'il's (Ishmael) wife about him, she replied, 'He has
gone in search of our livelihood.' Then he asked her about their way of living and their
condition, and she replied, 'We are living in misery; we are living in hardship and
destitution,' complaining to him. He said, 'When your husband returns, convey my
salutation to him and tell him to change the threshold of the gate (of his house).' When
lsmA'il (Ishmael) came, he seemed to have felt something unusual, so he asked his wife,
'Has anyone visited you?' She replied, 'Yes, an old man of such and such description
came and asked me about you and I informed him, and he asked about our state of living,
and I told him that we were living in a hardship and poverty.' On that lsmA'il (Ishmael) said,
'Did he advise you anything?' She replied, 'Yes, he told me to convey his salutation to you
and to tell you to change the threshold of your gate.' lsma'il (Ishmael) said, 'It was my
father, and he has ordered me to divorce you. Go back to your family.' So, lsma'il (Ishmael)
divorced her and married another woman from amongst them (i.e. Jurhum). Then Ibrahim
(Abraham) stayed away from them for a period as long as AIIAh wished and called on them
again but did not find lsma'il (Ishmael). So he came to lsmA'il's (Ishmael) wife and asked
her about lsmA'il (Ishmael). She said, 'He has gone in search of our livelihood.' Ibrahim
(Abraham) asked her, 'How are you getting on?' asking her about their sustenance and
living. She replied, 'We are prosperous and well-off (i.e. we have everything in abundance).'
Then she thanked Allah ~ J r· Ibrahim (Abraham) said, 'What kind of food do you eat?'
She said, 'Meat.' He said, 'What do you drink?' She said, 'Water.' He said, 'O Allah! Bless
their meat and water.' "The Prophet r-1--J ~ ..ii 1 ~ added, "At that time they did not have
grain, and if they had grain, he would have also invoked Allah to bless it." The Prophet~
r!:-J ~ ..ii I added, "If somebody has only these two things as his sustenance, his health and
disposition will be badly affected, unless he lives in Makkah." The Prophet
',!ls ..ll 1 ~
added, "Then Ibrahim (Abraham) said to lsma'il's (Ishmael) wife, 'When your husband
comes, give my regards to him and tell him that he should keep firm the threshold of his
gate.' When lsmA'il (Ishmael) came back, he asked his wife, 'Did anyone call on you?' She
replied, 'Yes, a good-looking old man came to me,' so she praised him and added. 'He
asked about you, and I informed him, and he asked about our livelihood and I told him that
we were in a good condition.' lsmA'il (Ishmael) asked her, 'Did he give you any piece of
advice?' She said, 'Yes, he told me to give his regards to you and ordered that you should
keep firm the threshold of your gate.' On that lsmA'il (Ishmael) said, 'It was my father, and
you are the threshold (of the gate). He has ordered me to keep you with me.' Then lbrAhim
(Abraham) stayed away from them for a period as long as Allah wished, and called on them
afterwards. He saw lsma'il (Ishmael) under a tree near Zamzam, sharpening his arrows.
When he saw lbrAhim (Abraham), he rose up to welcome him (and they greeted each other
as a father does with his son or a son does with his father). Ibrahim (Abraham) said, 'O
lsmA'il (Ishmael)! Allah has given me an order.' lsma'il (Ishmael) said, 'Do what your Lord
has ordered you to do.' Ibrahim (Abraham) asked, 'Will you help me?' lsma'il (Ishmael)
said, 'I will help you.' Ibrahim (Abraham) said, 'Allah has ordered me to build a house here,'
pointing to a hillock higher than the land surrounding it.' • The Prophet r:-:J ~ ..ll 1~ added,
"Then they raised the foundations of the House (i.e. the Ka'bah). lsmA'il (Ishmael) brought
the stones and lbrAhim (Abraham) was building; and when the walls became high, lsmA'il
(Ishmael) brought this stone and put it for Ibrahim (Abraham) who stood over it and carried
on building, while lsma'il (Ishmael) was handing him the stones, and both of them were
saying, 'O our Lord! Accept (this service) from us. Verily, You are the All-Hearer the
All-Knower.'" (V.2:127).

71. And Allah has preferred some of you
above others in wealth and properties. Then,
those who are preferred will by no means
hand over their wealth and properties to those
(slaves) whom their right hands possess, so
that then may be equal with them in respect
thereof 1 . Do they then deny the Favour of
Allah?
72. And Allah has made for you Azwaj
(mates or wives) of your own kind, and has
made for you, from your wives, sons and
grandsons, and has bestowed on you good
provision. Do they then believe in false
deities and deny the Favour of Allah (by not
worshipping Allah Alone).

111 (V.16:71 ):
a) This example Allah has set forth for the polytheists (pagans) who associate false deities
with Allah, that they would not agree to share their wealth and properties with their slaves,
then how do they agree to share false deities with Allah in His worship?
b) Allah's Statement: "And Allah .. ." (V.16:71). Narrated Abu Hurairah ~ .iii ,,ri>J: The
Prophet r-1--J ~ .ii, ~ said, "Prophet Ibrahim (Abraham) r.)l..J' ~ emigrated with Sarah and
entered a village where there was a king from amongst the kings or a tyrant from amongst
the tyrants. (The king) was told that Ibrahim (Abraham) had entered (the village)
accompanied by a woman who was one of the most charming women. So, the king sent for
Ibrahim (Abraham) and asked, 'O Ibrahim (Abraham)! Who is this lady accompanying
you?' Ibrahim (Abraham) replied, 'She is my sister (i.e., in religion).' Then Ibrahim
(Abraham) returned to her and said, 'Do not contradict my statement, for I have informed
them that you are my sister. By Allah, there are not true believers on the earth except you
and I.' Then Ibrahim (Abraham) sent her to the king. When the king got to her, she got up
and performed ablution, offered Sal§t {prayer) and said, 'O Allah! If I have believed in You
and Your Messenger, and have guarded my private parts from everybody except my
husband, then please do not let this disbeliever overpower me.' On that the king fell in a
state of unconsiousness (or had an epileptic fit) and started moving his legs. Seeing the
condition of the king, Sarah said, 'O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that I have
killed him.' The king regained his power, and proceeded towards her but she got up again
and performed ablution, offered Sa/§t (prayer) and said, 'O Allah! If I have believed in You
and Your Messenger and have kept my private parts safe from all except my husband, then
please do not let this disbeliever overpower me.' The king again fell in a state of
unconsciousness (or had epileptic fit) and started moving his legs. On seeing that state of
the king, Sarah said, 'O Allah! If he should die, the people will say that I have killed him.'
The king got either two or three attacks, and after recovering from the last attack he said,
'By Allah! You have sent a Satan to me. Take her to Ibrahim (Abraham) and give her Agar
(Hagar).' So she came back to Ibrahim (Abraham) and said, 'Allah humiliated the
disbeliever and gave us a slave-girl for service.'· (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Hadith No. 420)

74. So put not forward similitudes for
Allah (as there is nothing similar to Him, nor
He resembles anything). Truly! Allah knows
and you know not.
75. Allah puts forward the example of
(two men - a believer and a disbeliever); a
slave (disbeliever) under the possession of
another, he has no power of any sort, and (the
other), a man (believer) on whom We have
bestowed a good provision from Us, and he
spends thereof secretly and openly. Can they
be equal? (By no means). All the praises and
thanks are to Allah. Nay! (But) most of them
know not.
76. And Allah puts forward (another) example
of two men, one of them dumb, who has no power
over anything (disbeliever), and he is a burden on
his master; whichever way he directs him, he
brings no good. Is such a man equal to one
(believer in the Islamic Monotheism) who
commands justice, and is himself on the Straight
Path?
77. And to Allah belongs the Unseen of
the heavens and the earth. And the matter of
the Hour is not but as a twinkling of the eye,
or even nearer. Truly! Allah is Able to do all
things.

hides of the cattle (tents for) dwelling, which
you find so light (and handy) when you travel

their wool, fur, and hair (sheep wool, camel

called Sarah and when she went to him, he tried to take hold of her with his hand, but (his
hand got stiff and) he was confounded. He asked Sarah, "Pray to Allah for me, and I shall
not harm you." So Sarah asked Allah to cure him and he got cured. He tried to take hold of
her for the second time, but his hand got as stiff as or stiffer than before and) was more

Sarah asked Allah again and he became right. He then called one of his guards (who had
brought her) and said, "You have not brought me a human being but have brought me a
devil." The tyrant then gave Hajar as a girl-servant to Sarah. Sarah came back [to Ibrahim
(Abraham)] while he was praying. Ibrahim (Abraham), gesturing with his hand, asked,
"What has happened?" She replied "Allah has spoiled the evil plot of the infidel (or immoral

"That (Hajar) was your mother, 0 Bani Ma'-is-Sama' (i.e. the Arabs)." (Sahih Al-Bukhari,

*The idolaters invited Ibrahim (Abraham) to join them in their celebrations outside the city,
but he refused, claiming that he was sick. When he was left alone, he came to their idols
and broke them into pieces. When the idolaters questioned him, he claimed that he had not
destroyed their idols but the chief idol had, which Ibrahim (Abraham) left undisturbed and

Narrated Abu MOsa ~ 4111 ,.,;,/ The Prophet r1-J <.;J,, 4111 ~ said, "None is more patient than
Allah against the harmful saying He hears from the people, they ascribe a son (or offspring)
to Him, yet He gives them health and (supplies them with) provision." (Sahih Al-Bukhari,
Vol. 8, Hadith No. 121)
b) Narrated 'Abdullah ,._;,, 4111 ~ 1 : The Prophet r:-'J ,._,,i,, 4111 .,i.., divided and distributed
something as he used to do with some of his distributions. A man from the Ansar said, "By
Allah! in this division the pleasure of Allah has not been intended." I said, "I will definitely
tell this to the Prophet rL J ,._,,i,, 4111 .,i..,." So I went to him while he was sitting with his
companions and told him of it secretly. That was hard upon the Prophet ~J <.;J,, 4111 ~ and
the colour of his face changed, and he became so angry that I wished I had not told him.
The Prophet rL.,,J <.;J,, ..ii 1 ..;.., then said, "MOsa (Moses) was harmed with more than this, yet
he remained patient." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 8, Hadith No. 122)

not be saved by your deeds), 0 Allah's Messenger?" He said, "No, even I (will not be
saved) unless and until Allah bestows His Mercy on me and protects me with His Grace.
Therefore, do good deeds properly, sincerely and moderately, and worship Allah in the
forenoon and in the afternoon and during a part of the night, and always adopt a middle,
moderate, regular course whereby you will reach your target (Paradise)." ( Sahih

whoever goes astray, then he goes astray to
his own loss. No one laden with burdens can
bear another's burden. And We never punish

against you a hurricane of wind and drown
you because of your disbelief? Then you will
not find any avenger therein against Us.

Children of Adam, and We have carried them
on land and sea, and have provided them with
At-Tayyibiit {lawful good things), and have
preferred them above many of those whom
We have created with a marked preferment.

Abi Jahl fled from Allah's Messenger

conquered. He rode over the (Red) Sea to cross over to Ethiopia, but (as they proceeded),
a heavy stormy wind overtook their boat, and huge waves came to them from all sides, and
they thought that they are encircled therein. The people of the boat said to one another:
"None can save you except Allah (the Only True God of the heavens and earth). So invoke
(call upon) Him (Allah) (by making your Faith pure for Him Alone and none else) to deliver
you safe (from drowning)." 'lkrimah said to himself. 'By Allah if none can benefit in the sea
except Allah (Alone) then no doubt none can benefit over the land except Allah (Alone). 0
Allah! I promise You that if You delivered me safe from this, I will go and put my hands in
the hands of (Prophet) Muhammad and surely I will find him full of pity, kindness and
mercy.' So they were delivered safe (by AIIAh), and returned to their sea-shore and came
out of the sea. 'lkrimah then proceeded to Allah's Messenger, Muhammad ,-1-J ~ ,ji I J- ,
(narrated his story), embraced Islam Oust as he promised Allah), and became a perfect
Muslim." (Tafsir lbn Kathir).

In the Name ofAllah

righteous deeds, that they shall have a fair
reward (i.e. Paradise).
3. They shall abide therein for ever.
4. And to warn those (Jews, Christians,
and pagans) who say, "Allfill has begotten a
son (or offspring or children)."

S. No knowledge have they of such a
thing, nor had their fathers. Mighty is the
word that comes out of their mouths [i.e. He
begot sons and daughters]. They utter nothing
but a lie111•
6. Perhaps, you, would kill yourself (0
Muhammad ,.i-, ~.:»,.;..)in grief, over their
footsteps (for their turning away jrom you),
because they believe not in this narration (the
Qur'ftn).
7. Verily! We have made that which is on
earth as an adornment for it, in order that We
may test them (mankind) as to which of them
are best in deeds. [Le.those who do good deeds
in the most perfect manner, that means to do
them (deeds) totally for Allfill 's sake and in

9. Do you think that the people of the
Cave and the Inscription (the news or the
names of the people of the Cave) were a
wonder among Our Signs?
10. (Remember) when the young men fled
for refuge (from their disbelieving folk) to the

in the Cave for a number of years.

12. Then We raised them up (from their
sleep), that We might test which of the two
parties was best at calculating the time period
that they had tarried.

13. We narrate unto you (0 Muhammad

were young men who believed in their Lord

14. And We made their hearts firm and
strong (with the light of Faith in Allah and
bestowed upon them patience to bear the
separation of their kith and kin and
dwellings.) when they stood up and said:
"Our Lord is the Lord of the heavens and the
earth, never shall we call upon any ildh (god)
other than Him; ifwe did, we should indeed
have uttered an enormity in disbelief.
15. "These our people have taken for
worship d/ihah (gods) other than Him
(Allah). Why do they not bring for them a
clear authority? And who does more wrong
than he who invents a lie against Allah.
16. (The young men said to one another):
"And when you withdraw from them, and that

which they worship, except Allfill, then seek
refuge in the Cave; your Lord will open a way
for you from His Mercy and will make easy
for you your affair (i.e. will give you what
you will need of provision, dwelling)."
17. And you might have seen the sun,
when it rose, declining to the right from their
Cave, and when it set, turning away from
them to the left, while they lay in the midst of
the Cave. That is (one) of the Aydt (proofs,
evidences, signs) of Allfill. He whom Allfill
guides, he is the rightly guided; but he whom
He sends astray, for him you will find no Wali
(guiding friend) to lead him (to the right
Path).

18. And you would have thought them
awake, whereas they were asleep. And We
turned them on their right and on their left
sides, and their dog stretching forth his two
forelegs at the entrance [of the Cave or in the
space near to the entrance of the Cave (as a
guard at the gate)]. Had you looked at them,
you would certainly have turned back from
them in flight, and would certainly have been
filled with awe of them.

19. Likewise, We awakened them (from
their long deep sleep) that they might
question one another. A speaker from among
them said: "How long have you stayed
(here)?" They said: "We have stayed
(perhaps) a day or part of a day." They said:
"Your Lord (Alone) knows best how long you
have stayed (here). So send one of you with
this silver coin of yours to the town, and let
him find out which is the good lawful food,
and bring some of that to you. And let him be
careful and let no man know of you.
20. "For, if they come to know ofyou,
they will stone you (to death or abuse and
harm you) or turn you back to their religion;
and in that case you will never be successful."

21. And thus We made their case known (to
the people), that they might know that the
Promise of Allfill is true, and that there can be
no doubt about the Hour. (Remember) when
they (the people of the city) disputed among
themselves about their case, they said:
"Construct a building over them; their Lord
knows best about them;" (then) those who won
their point said (most probably the
disbelievers): "We verily shall build a place of
worship over them."
22. (Some) say they were three, the dog
being the fourth among them; and (others)
say they were five, the dog being the sixth, guessing at the unseen; (yet others) say they
were seven, and the dog being the eighth. Say
(0 Muhammad t1--J ~ .ii 1 ~ ) : "My Lord
knows best their number; none knows them
but a few." So debate not (about their
number) except with the clear proof (which
We have revealed to you). And consult not
any of them (people of the Scripture - Jews
and Christians) about (the affair of) the
people of the Cave.

23. And never say of anything, "I shall do
such and such thing tomorrow."
24. Except (with the saying), "If Allfill
will!" And remember your Lord when you
forget and say: "It may be that my Lord
guides me unto a nearer way of truth than
this."

25. And they stayed in their Cave three
hundred (solar) years, adding nine (for lunar
years). (I'afsir AI-Qurtubi)
26. Say: "Allah knows best how long they
stayed. With Him is (the knowledge of) the
Unseen of the heavens and the earth. How
clearly He sees, and hears (everything)! They
have no Wali (Helper, Disposer of affairs,
Protector) other than Him, and He makes
none to share in His Decision and His Rule."

Verily, We have prepared for the Zalimun

they prostrated themselves except lb/is

60. And (remember) when Musa (Moses)
said to his boy-servant: "I will not give up
(travelling) until I reach the junction of the
two seas or (until) I spend years and years in
travelling. "111
111 ('J.18:60) The Story of MOsa (Moses) and Khidr r'Jl..J' l.+;)s. Narrated Sa'ld bin Jubair: I
said to lbn 'AbbAs, "Nauf AI-Bikali claims that Musa (Moses), the companion of AI-Khidr
was not the Musa (Moses) of the Children of Israel.· lbn 'Abbas said, "The enemy of Allah
(Nauf) told a lie." Narrated 'Ubayy bin Ka'b that he heard Allah's Messenger r:-'J ~ ..ii 1 .;...,
saying, "Musa (Moses) got up to deliver a speech before the Children of Israel and he was
asked, 'Who is the most learned person among the people?' MOsa (Moses) replied, 'I (am
the most learned).' Allah admonished him for he did not ascribe knowledge to Allah Alone.
So Allah revealed to him: 'At the junction of the two seas there is a slave of Ours who is
more learned than you.' Musa (Moses) asked, 'O my Lord, how can I meet him?' Allah said,
'Take a fish and put it in a basket and then proceed (set out and where you lose the fish,
you will find him).' So Musa (Moses) (took a fish and put it in a basket and) set out, along
with his boy-servant Yusha' bin NOn, till they reached a rock (on which) they both lay their
heads and slept. The fish moved vigorously in the basket and got out of it and fell into the
sea and there it took its way through the sea (straight) as in a tunnel. ('J.18:61) Allah
stopped the current of water on both sides of the way created by the fish, and so that way
was like a tunnel. When Musa (Moses) got up, his companion forgot to tell him about the
fish, and so they carried on their journey during the rest of the day and the whole night. The
next morning Musa (Moses) asked his boy-servant 'Bring us our morning meal; truly, we
have suffered much fatigue in this, our journey.' ('J.18:62)
Musa (Moses) did not get tired till he had passed the place which Allah had ordered him to
seek after. His boy-servant then said to him, 'Do you remember when we betook ourselves
to the rock? I indeed forgot the fish; none but Satan made me forget to remember it. It took
its course into the sea in a strange way.' ('J.18:63)
There was a tunnel for the fish and for Musa (Moses) and his boy-servant there was
astonishment. Musa (Moses) said, 'That is what we have been seeking'. So they went back
retracing their footsteps. ('J.18:64) They both returned, retracing their steps till they reached
the rock. Behold! There they found a man covered with a garment. Musa (Moses) greeted
him. AI-Khidr said astonishingly. 'Is there such a greeting in your land?' Musa (Moses) said,
'I am Musa (Moses).' He said, 'Are you the MOsa (Moses) of the Children of Israel?' Musa
(Moses) said, 'Yes'; and added, 'I have come to you so that you may teach me something
of that knowledge which you have been taught'.
AI-Kbidr said, 'You will not be able to have patience with me.' ('J.18:67)
MOsa (Moses)! I have some of Allah's Knowledge which He has bestowed upon me but
you do not know it; and you too, have some of Allah's Knowledge which He has bestowed
upon you, but I do not know it." Musa (Moses) said, 'If Allah wills, you will find me patient,
and I will not disobey you in aught.' (V.18:69).
AI-Khidr said to him. 'Then, if you follow me, ask me not about anything till I myself mention
it to you.' ('J.18:70). After that both of them proceeded along the sea coast, till a ship
passed by and they requested the crew to let them go on board. The crew recognized
AI-Khidr and allowed them to get on board free of charge. When they got on board,
suddenly Musa (Moses) saw that AI-Khidr had pulled out one of the planks of the ship with
an adze. Musa (Moses) said to him, 'These people gave us a free lift, yet you have scuttled
their ship so as to drown its people! Verily, you have committed a thing 'lmra' (a Munkarevil, bad, dreadful thing).' ('J.18:71)
AI-Khidr said, 'Did I not tell you, that you would not be able to have patience with me?'
(V.18:72)
Musa (Moses) said, 'Call me not to account for what I forgot and be not hard upon me for
my affair (with you.)' (V.18:73)."

he had forgotten. Then a sparrow came and sat over the edge of the ship and dipped its
beak once in the sea. AI-Khidr said to MOsli (Moses), 'My knowledge and your knowledge,
compared to Allah's Knowledge is like what this sparrow has taken out of the sea.' Then
they both got out of the ship, and while they were walking on the sea shore, AI-Khidr saw a
boy playing with other boys. AI-Khidr got hold of the head of that boy and pulled it out with
his hands and killed him. MOsli (Moses) said, 'Have you killed an innocent person who had
killed none! Verily, you have committed a thing 'Nukra' (a great Munkar - prohibited. evil,

patience with me?' (V.18:75) (The subnarrator said, 'The second blame was stronger than
the first one). MOsli (Moses) said, 'If I ask you anything after this, keep me not in your
company; you have received an excuse from me.' (V.18:76)
Then they both proceeded until they came to the people of a town. They asked them for
food but they refused to entertain them. (Then) they found there a wall on the point of falling
down. (V.18:77) (AI-Khidr) set it up straight with his own hands. MOsli (Moses) said, 'We
came to these people, but they neither fed us nor received us as guests. If you had wished,
you could surely have exacted some recompense for it.' (AI-Khidr) said, 'This is the parting

100. And on that Day We shall present
Hell to the disbelievers, plain to view101. (To) those whose eyes had been
under a covering from My Reminder {this
Qur'an), and who could not bear to hear (it).
102. Do then those who disbelieved think
that they can take My slaves [i.e., the angels,
Allah's Messengers, 'Isa (Jesus), son of
Maryam (Mary)] as Auliya' (lords, gods,
protectors) besides Me? Verily, We have
prepared Hell as an entertainment for the
disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism) 111 •
103. Say (0 Muhammad r-1--J ~ .»1 ..;..,):

104. "Those whose efforts have been
wasted in this life while they thougi1t that they

monks to be their lords (by obeying them in things that they made lawful or unlawful
according to their own desires without being ordered by Allah) besides Allah, and (they also
took as their Lord) Messiah, son of Maryam (Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were
commanded [in the TaurAt (Torah) and the lnjeel (Gospel)) to worship none but one I/ah
(God - Allah), Ul ilaha ii/a Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and
Glory be to Him, (far above is He) from having the partners they associate (with Him)."
(The Our'An, Verse 9:31]
Once, while Allah's Messenger ,-LJ ~ .ii 1 ~ was reciting the above Verse, 'Adi bin Hatim
said, "O Allah's Prophet! They do not worship them (rabbis and monks)." Allah's Messenger
r!:-J ~ .ii 1 ~ said, "They certainly do. They (i.e. rabbis and monks) made legal things
illegal, and illegal things legal, and they (i.e. Jews and Christians) followed them, and by
doing so they really worshipped them." [Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, and lbn Jarir.
f];afsirAt-Tabari, Vol.10, Page No.114)]
(V.18:104) For the acceptance of the righteous deeds it is stipulated that the following
two basic conditions must be fulfilled:
a) The intentions while doing such deeds must be totally for AIIAh's sake only without any
show-off or to gain praise or fame.
b) Such a deed must be performed in accordance with the Sunnah of Allah's Messenger
Muhammad bin 'Abdullah ,-LJ ~ .:ii , ~. the last of the Prophets and the Messengers.

11. Then he came out to his people from
Al-Mihrab (a praying place or a private room)
and he told them by signs to glorify Allah's
Praises in the morning and in the afternoon.
12. (It was said to his son): "O Yahya
(John)! Hold fast the Scripture [the Taurat
(Torah)]." And We gave him wisdom while
yet a child.
13. And (made him) sympathetic to men
as a mercy (or a grant) from Us, and pure
from sins [i.e. Yahya (John)] and he was
righteous,
14. And dutiful towards his parents, and
he was neither arrogant nor disobedient (to
Allah or to his parents).

Maryam (Mary), when she withdrew in
seclusion from her family to a place facing
east.

17. She placed a screen (to screen herself)

before her in the form of a man in all

said: 'That is easy for Me (Allah): And (We
wish) to appoint him as a sign to mankind and
a mercy from Us (Allah), and it is a matter
(already) decreed, (by Allah).' "

22. So she conceived him,11 1 and she
withdrew with him to a far place (i.e.
Bethlehem valley about 4-6 miles from
Jerusalem).
23. And the pains of childbirth drove her
to the trunk of a date-palm. She said: "Would
that I had died before this, and had been
forgotten and out of sight!"
24. Then [the babe 'Isa (Jesus) or Jibril
(Gabriel)] cried unto her from below her,
saying: "Grieve not: your Lord has provided a
water stream under you.
25. "And shake the trunk of date-palm
towards you, it will let fall fresh ripe-dates
upon you."
26. "So eat and drink and be glad. And if
you see any human being, say: 'Verily! I have
vowed a fast unto the Most Gracious (Allah)
so I shall not speak to any human being this
day."'

her people, carrying him. They said: "O
Mary! Indeed you have brought a thing

only count out to them a (limited) number (of

protects all that exists). And he who carried (a
burden
of) wrongdoing (i.e. he who
disbelieved in Allah, ascribed partners to
Him, and did deeds of His disobedience), will
be indeed a complete failure (on that Day).
112. And he who works deeds of
righteousness, while he is a believer (in
Islamic Monotheism), then he will have no
fear of injustice, nor of any curtailment (of his
reward).
113. And thus We have sent it down as a
Qur'an in Arabic, and have explained therein
in detail the warnings, in order that they may
fear Allah, or that it may cause them to have a
lesson from it (or to have the honour for
believing and acting on its teachings).
114. Then High above all be Allah, the
True King. And be not in haste (0
Muhammad r-1---J <...,i)$ ..:ii,~) with the Qur'an
before its revelation is completed to you, and
say: "My Lord! Increase me in knowledge."
115. And indeed We made a covenant
with Adam before, but he forgot, and We
found on his part no firm will-power.

116. And (remember) when We said to
the angels: "Prostrate yourselves to Adam."
They prostrated themselves (all) except lb/is

is an enemy to you and to your wife. So let
him not get you both out of Paradise, so that

120. Then Shaittin (Satan) whispered to
him, saying : "O Adam! Shall I lead you to
the Tree of Eternity and to a kingdom that
will never waste away?"
121. Then they both ate of the tree, and so
their private parts became manifest to them,
and they began to cover themselves with the
leaves of the Paradise for their covering. Thus
did Adam disobey his Lord, so he went
astray.
122. Then his Lord chose him, and turned
to him with forgiveness, and gave him
guidance.
123. He (Allah) said:"Get you down (from
the Paradise to the earth), both of you,
together, some of you are an enemy to some
others. Then if there comes to you guidance
from Me, then whoever follows My Guidance
he shall neither go astray, nor shall be
distressed.
124. "But whosoever turns away from My
Reminder (i.e. neither believes in this Qur'an
nor acts on its teachings.) verily, for him is a
life of hardship, and We shall raise him up
blind on the Day of Resurrection."

125. He will say:"O my Lord! Why have

126. (Allah) will say: "Like this: Our Aydt
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.) came unto you, but you
disregarded them (i.e. you left them, did not
think deeply in them, and you turned away
from them), and so this Day, you will be
neglected (in the Hell-fire, away from Allah's

127. And thus do We requite him who
transgresses beyond bounds [i.e. commits the
great sins and disobeys his Lord (Allah) and
believes not in His Messengers, and His
revealed Books, like this Qur'iin], and
believes not in the Aydt (proofs, evidences,
verses, lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of his
Lord; and the torment of the Hereafter is far
more severe and more lasting.
128. Is it not a guidance for them (to
know) how many generations We have
destroyed before them, in whose dwellings
they walk? Verily, in this are signs indeed for
men of understanding.
129. And had it not been for a Word that
went forth before from your Lord, and a term
determined,
(their
punishment)
must
necessarily have come (in this world).
130. So bear patiently (0 Muhammad _,i..,

praises of your Lord before the rising of the
sun, and before its setting, and during some
hours of the night, and at the ends of the day
(an indication for the five compulsory
congregational prayers), that you may
become pleased with the reward which Allah
shall give you.
131. And strain not your eyes in longing
for the things We have given for enjoyment to
various groups of them (polytheists and
disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah), the
splendour of the life of this world, that We
may test them thereby. But the provision

is better and more lasting.

before this (i.e. Messenger
Muhammad r,l--J ~ ..:u 1 ~ and the Qur'an),
they would surely have said: "Our Lord! If
only You had sent us a Messenger, we should

who are they that are on the Straight and Even
Path (i.e. Allah's religion of Islamic
Monotheism), and who are they that have let

111 (V.20:134) Narrated Abu Sa'id Al-Khudri ~ ..:u 1~;: 'Ali bin Abi Talib sent a piece of gold,
not yet taken out of its ore, in a tanned leather container to AIIAh's Messenger ~ .ii 1 .)~J- AIIAh's Messenger ,.L,J ~ ..:u 1._;.., distributed that amongst four persons: 'Uyainah oin

these (persons)." When that news reached the Prophet rl:--J ~ .ii 1._;..,, he said, "Don't you
trust me though I am the trustworthy man of the One in the heavens, and I receive the
news of heavens (i.e. Divine Revelation) both in the morning and in the evening?" There got
up a man with sunken eyes, raised cheek bones, raised forehead, a thick beard, a shaven
head and a waist-sheet that was tucked up and he said, ·o Allah's Messenger! Be afraid of
AIIAh." The Prophet r-1-:-J ~ .ii 1._;.., said, "Woe to you! Am I not of all the people of the earth
the most entitled to fear AIIAh?" Then that man went away. KhAlid bin AI-Walid said, "O

have not been ordered (by AIIAh) to search the hearts of the people or cut open their
bellies.· Then the Prophet ,.L,J ~ ..:U 1 ._;.., looked at him (i.e. that man) while the latter was
going away and said, "From the offspring of this (man) there will come out (people) who will
recite the Qur'An continuously and elegantly but it will not exceed their throats. (They will
neither understand it nor act upon it). They would go out of the religion (i.e., discard Islam)
as an arrow goes out through a game's body." I think he also said, "If I should be present at
their time, I would kill them as the nations of ThamOd were killed." [Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 5,

87. And (remember) Dhun-Nfin (Jonah),
when he went off in anger, and imagined that
We shall not punish him (i.e. the calamites
which had befallen him)! But he cried
through the darkness (saying): La ilaha ilia
Anta [none has the right to be worshipped but
You (0, Allah)], Glorified (and Exalted) be
You [above all that (evil) they associate with
You]! Truly, I have been of the
wrong-doers."

88. So We answered his call, and
delivered him from the distress. And thus We
do deliver the believers (who believe in the
Oneness of Allah, abstain from evil and work
righteousness).
89. And
(remember)
Zakariyya
(Zachariah), when he cried to his Lord: "O
My Lord! Leave me not single (childless),
though You are the Best of the inheritors."
90. So We answered his call, and We
bestowed upon him Yahya (John), and cured
his wife (to bear a child) for him. Verily, they
used to hasten on to do good deeds, and they

91. And she who guarded her chastity
[Virgin Maryam (Mary)]: We breathed into
(the sleeves of) her (shirt or garment)
[through Our Ruh - Jibril (Gabriel)]/ 11 and
We made her and her son ['Isa (Jesus)] a sign
for Al- 'Alamin (the mankind and jinn).
92. Truly! This, your Ummah [Shari'ah or

religion, and I am your Lord, therefore
worship Me (Alone). [Taftir lbn Kathir]

93. But they have broken up and differed
as regards their religion among themselves.
(And) they all shall return to Us.

deeds while he is a believer (in the Oneness

will not be rejected. Veri~ We record it for
him (in his Book of deeds). 1

97. And the true promise (Day of
Resurrection) shall draw near (of fulfillment).
Then (when mankind is resurrected from their
graves), you shall see the eyes of the
disbelievers fixedly staring in horror. (They
will say): "Woe to us! We were indeed
heedless of this - nay, but we were Zdlimiin
(polytheists and wrong-doers)."

111 (V. 22:5) Narrated 'Abdullah ~ .ii, ~;: Allah's Messenger r-'J ~ .ii, c)..,, the true and
truly inspired said: "(As regards your creation), every one of you is collected in the womb of
his mother for the first forty days, and then he becomes a clot for another forty days, and
then a piece of flesh for another forty days. Then Allah sends an angel to write four words:
He writes his deeds, time of his death, means of his livelihood, and whether he will be
wretched or blessed (in the Hereafter). Then the soul is breathed into his body. So a man
may do deeds characteristic of the people of the (Hell) Fire, so much so that there is only
the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has been written (by the angel)
surpasses; and so he starts doing deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise and
enters Paradise. Similarly, a person may do deeds characteristic of the people of Paradise,
so much so that there is only the distance of a cubit between him and it, and then what has
been written (by the angel) surpasses, and he starts doing deeds of the people of the (Hell)
Fire and enters the (Hell) Fire." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.4, Hadith No.549).
!21 (V.22:9) Narrated Abdullah bin Mas'Od ,...;.. .ii, .,.;,; : Allah's Messenger r1--J ~ .ii, .)said, "Whosoever has pride in his heart equal to the weight of an atom (or a small ant) shall
not enter Paradise." A person (amongst the audience) said, "Verily, a person loves that his

11. And among mankind is he who
worships Allah as it were, upon the edge (i.e.
in doubt): if good befalls him, he is content
therewith; but if a trial befalls him he turns
back on his face (i.e. reverts to disbelief after
embracing Islam). He loses both this world
and the Hereafter. That is the evident loss.
12. He calls besides Allah unto that
which can neither harm him, nor profit him.
That is a straying far away.
13. He calls unto him whose harm is
nearer than his profit: certainly, an evil Mau/a
(patron) and certainly an evil friend!
14. Truly, Allah will admit those who
believe (in Islamic Monotheism) and do
righteous good deeds ( according to the

a) Every Muslim, male or female, is obliged to offer his Sa/at (prayers) regularly five times a
day at the specified times; the male in the mosque in congregation and the female at home.
As the Prophet ,-L-J ~ .ii 1 ._).. has said: Order your children to perform Sa/at (prayer) at the
age of seven and beat them (about it) at the age of ten. The chief (of a family, town, tribe,
etc.) and the Muslim rulers of a country are held responsible before Allah in case of
non-fulfilment ofthisobligation by the Muslims under their authority.
b) One must offer the Sa/at (prayers) as the Prophet ,-L-J -.u .ii 1 ._).. used to offer them with
all their rules and regulations. i.e., standing, bowing, prostrating, sitting, etc. As he .ii 1 ._)..

"Certainly, I intended (or was about) to order the Mu'adhdhin (call-maker) to pronounce
lqamah and order a man to lead the Sa/at (prayer) and then take a fire flame to burn all

respite to the disbelievers for a while, then I
seized them, and how (terrible) was My

45. And many a township did We destroy

Verily, it is not the eyes that grow blind, but it

And verily, a day with your Lord is as a

52. Never did We send a Messenger or a
Prophet before you but when he did recite the
revelation or narrated or spoke, Shaitan
(Satan) threw (some falsehood) in it. But
Allah abolishes that which Shaitan (Satan)
throws in. Then Allah establishes His
Revelations. And Allah is All-Knower,
All-Wise:
53. That He (Allah) may make what is
thrown in by Shaitan (Satan) a trial for those
in whose hearts is a disease (of hypocrisy and
disbelief) and whose hearts are hardened.
And certainly, the Zalimun (polytheists and
wrong-doers) are in an opposition far-off
(from the truth against Allah's Messenger and
the believers).
54. And that those who have been given
knowledge may know that it (this Qur'iin) is
the truth from your Lord, so that they may
believe therein, and their hearts may submit
to it with humility. And verily, Allah is the
Guide of those who believe, to the Straight
Path.
55. And those who disbelieved will not
cease to be in doubt about it (this Qur'iin)
until the Hour comes suddenly upon them, or
there comes to them the torment of the Day
after which there will be no night (i.e. the Day
of Resurrection).
56. The sovereignty on that Day will be
that of Allah (the One Who has no partners).
He will judge between them. So those who
believed (in the Oneness of Allah - Islamic
Monotheism) and did righteous good deeds
will be in Gardens of delight (Paradise).

57. And those who disbelieved and belied
Our Verses (of this Qur'iin), for them will be
a humiliating torment (in Hell).
58. Those who emigrated in the Cause of
Allah and after that were killed or died,
surely, Allah will provide a good provision
for them. And verily, it is Allah Who indeed
is the Best of those who make provision.

60. That is so. And whoever has retaliated
with the like of that which he was made to
suffer, and then has again been wronged,
Allah will surely help him. Verily Allah
indeed is Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.
61. That is because Allah merges the night
into the day, and He merges the day into the
night. And verily, Allah is All-Hearer,
All-Seer.

62. That is because Allah - He is the
Truth (the only True God of all that exists,
Who has no partners or rivals with Him), and
what they (the polytheists) invoke besides
Him, it is Bdtil (falsehood). And verily, Allah
- He is the Most High, the Most Great.
63. See you not that Allah sends down
water (rain) from the sky, and then the earth
becomes green? Verily, Allah is the Most
Kind and Courteous, Well-Acquainted with
all things.

64. To Him belongs all that is in the
heavens and all that is on the earth. And
verily, Allah He is Rich (Free of all
needs), Worthy of all praise.
65. See you not that Allah has subjected
to you (mankind) all that is on the earth, and
the ships that sail through the sea by His
Command? He withholds the heaven from
falling on the earth except by His Leave.
Verily, Allah is, for mankind, Full of
Kindness, Most Merciful.
66. It is He, Who gave you life, and then
will cause you to die, and will again give you
life (on the Day ofResurrection). Verily man
is indeed an ingrate.

(i.e. to eat of the cattle which you slaughter,
and not to eat of the cattle which Allah kills
by its natural death), but invite them to your
Lord. Verily you (0 Muhammad ...,i,, ..ll, ~

it is (all) in the Book (Al-Lauh-al-Mahfaz).
Verily that is easy for Allah.
71. And they worship besides Allah others
for which He has sent down no authority, and
of which they have no knowledge; and for the
Zdlimun (wrong-doers,
polytheists and
disbelievers in the Oneness of Allah) there is
no helper.

72. And when Our Clear Verses are
recited to them, you will notice a denial on
the faces of the disbelievers! They are nearly
ready to attack with violence those who recite
Our Verses to them. Say: "Shall I tell you of
something worse than that? The Fire (of Hell)
which Allah has promised to those who
disbelieved, and worst indeed is that
destination!"
73. 0 mankind! A similitude has been
coined, so listen to it (carefully): Verily those
on whom you call besides Allah, cannot
create (even) a fly, even though they combine
together for the purpose. And if the fly
snatches away a thing from them, they will
have no power to release it from the fly. So
weak are (both) the seeker and the sought.

angels and from men. Verily, Allah is
All-Hearer, All-Seer.
76. He knows what is before them, and
what is behind them. And to Allah return all
matters (for decision).
77. 0 you who have believed! Bow down,
and prostrate yourselves, and worship your
Lord and do good that you may be successful.
78. And strive hard in Allah's Cause as
you ought to strive (with sincerity and with all
your efforts that His Name should be
superior). He has chosen you (to convey His
Message of Islamic Monotheism to mankind
by inviting them to His religion oflslam), and
has not laid upon you in religion any
hardship: 111 it is the religion of your father
Ibrahim (Abraham) (Islamic Monotheism). It
is He (Allah) Who has named you Muslims
both before and in this (the Qur'an), that the
Messenger (Muhammad ri--J ~ .Ji 1 _;...) may
be a witness over you and you be witnesses
over mankind! 121 So perform As-Sa/tit
(Jqamat-as-Salat), give Zakiit and hold fast to
Allah [i.e. have confidence in Allah, and
depend upon Him in all your affairs]. He is
your Mau/a (Patron, Lord), what an Excellent
Mau/a (Patron, Lord) and what an Excellent
Helper!
111 (V.22:78) Religion is very easy. And the statement of the Prophet r.:'J ~ .ii 1 .;..,: "The

and whoever overburdens himself in his religion will not be able to continue in that way. So
you should not be extremists, but try to be near to perfection and receive the good tidings

Surat Al-Mu 'mintln .
(The Believers)~

In the Name ofAllah
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
1. Successful indeed are the believers.

2. Those who offer their Sai<it (prayers)
with all solemnity and full submissiveness.
3. And those who turn away from
A/-Laghw (dirty, false, evil vain talk,
falsehood, and all that Allah has forbidden).
4. And those who pay the Zakat .
5. And those who guard their chastity (i.e.
private parts, from illegal sexual acts)

6. Except from their wives or (the slaves)
that their right hands possess, - for then,
they are free from blame;
7. But whoever seeks beyond that, then
those are the transgressors;
8. Those who are faithfully true to their
Amandt (all the duties which Allah has
ordained, honesty, moral responsibility and
trusts) and to their covenants;
9. And those who strictly guard their (five
compulsory
congregational)
Salawdt
(prayers) (at their fixed stated hours).
10. These are indeed the inheritors
11. Who shall
inherit the Firdaus
(Paradise). They shall dwell therein forever.

12. And indeed We created man (Adam)
out of an extract of clay (water and earth).
13. Thereafter We
made him (the
offspring of Adam) as a Nutfah (mixed drops
of the male and female sexual discharge and
lodged it) in a safe lodging (womb of the
woman).

14. Then We made the Nutfah into a clot
(a piece of thick coagulated blood), then We
made the clot into a little lump of flesh, then
We made out of that little lump of flesh
bones, then We clothed the bones with flesh,
and then We brought it forth as another
creation. So Blessed is Allah, the Best of
creators.11 1

15. After that, surely, you will die.
16. Then (again), surely, you will be
resurrected on the Day of Resurrection.
17. And indeed We have created above
you seven heavens (one over the other), and
We are never unaware of the creation.
18. And We sent down from the sky water
(rain) in (due) measure, and We gave it
lodging in the earth, and verily, We are Able
to take it away.
19. Then We brought forth for you
therewith gardens of date-palms and grapes,
wherein is much fruit for you, and whereof
you eat.
20. And a tree (olive) that springs forth
from Mount Sinai, that grows (produces) oil,
and (it is a) relish for the eaters.
21. And verily in the cattle there is indeed
a lesson for you. We give you to drink (milk)
of that which is in their bellies. And there are,
in them, numerous (other) benefits for you,
and of them you eat.

22. And on them, and on ships you are
carried.

23. And indeed We sent Nuh (Noah) to
his people, and he said: "O my people!
Worship Allah! You have no other Ildh (God)
but Him (Islamic Monotheism). Will you not
then be afraid ( of Him i.e. of His punishment

24. But the chiefs of his people who
disbelieved said: "He is no more than a
human being like you, he seeks to make
himself superior to you. Had Allah willed, He
surely could have sent down angels. Never
did we hear such a thing among our fathers of
old.
25. "He is only a man in whom is
madness, so wait for him a while."

26. [Nub (Noah)] said: "0 my Lord! Help
me because they deny me."
27. So We revealed to him (saying):
"Construct the ship under Our Eyes and under
Our Revelation (guidance). Then, when Our
Command comes, and water gushes forth
from the oven, take on board of each kind two
(male and female), and your family, except
those thereof against whom the Word has
already gone forth. And address Me not in
favour of those who have done wrong. Verily,
they are to be drowned.
28. And when you have embarked on the
ship, you and whoever is with you, then say:
"All the praises and thanks be to Allah, Who
has saved us from the people who are
Zdlimun (i.e.
oppressors, wrong-doers,
polytheists, those who join others in worship
with Allah).

29. And say: "My Lord! Cause me to land
at a blessed landing-place, for You are the
Best of those who bring to land."
30. Verily, in this [what We did as regards
drowning of the people ofNQh (Noah)], there
are indeed Aydt (proofs, evidences, lessons,
signs, etc. for men to understand), for sure
We are ever putting (men) to the test.
31. Then, after them, We created another
generation.

32. And We sent to them a Messenger
from among themselves (saying): "Worship
Allah! You have no other Jldh (God) but
Him. Will you not then be afraid ( of Him i.e.
of His punishment because of worshipping
others besides Him)?"
33. And the chiefs of his people who
disbelieved and denied the Meeting in the
Hereafter, and whom We had given the
luxuries and comforts of this life, said: "He is
no more than a human being like you, he eats
of that which you eat, and drinks of what you
drink.
34. "If you were to obey a human being
like yourselves, then verily you indeed would
be losers.
35. "Does he promise you that when you
have died and have become dust and bones,
you shall come out alive (resurrected)?

promised!

39. He said: "O my Lord! Help me

40. (Allah) said: "In a little while, they are
sure to be regretful."

41. So As-Saihah (torment - awful cry)
overtook them in truth (with justice), and We
made them as rubbish of dead plants. So away
with the people who are Zdlimun (polytheists,
wrong-doers, disbelievers in the Oneness of
Allah, disobedient to His Messengers).

43. No nation can advance their term, nor
can they delay it.
44. Then We sent Our Messengers in
succession. Every time there came to a nation
their Messenger, they denied him; so We
made them follow one another (to
destruction), and We made them as Ahadith
(the true stories for mankind to learn a lesson
from them). So away with a people who
believe not!
45. Then We sent Musa (Moses) and his
brother Harun (Aaron), with Our Aydt
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.) and manifest authority,
46. To Fir'aun (Pharaoh) and his chiefs,
but they behaved insolently and they were
people self-exalting (by disobeying their
Lord, and exalting themselves over and above
the Messenger of Allah).

47. They said: "Shall we believe in two men
like ourselves, and their people are obedient to us
with humility (and we use them to serve us as we
like)."
48. So they denied them both [Musa
(Moses) and Hamn (Aaron)] and became of
those who were destroyed.

49. And indeed We gave Musa (Moses)
the Scripture, that they may be guided.
50. And We made the son of Maryam
(Mary) and his mother as a sign, and We gave
them refuge on high ground, a place of rest,
security and flowing streams.
51. 0 (you) Messengers! Eat of the Tayyibdt

Qur'an) which We have sent down and which
We have enjoined, (ordained its laws); and in
it We have revealed manifest Aydt (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, signs, revelations
lawful and unlawful things, and set
boundaries of Islamic Religion), that you may
remember.
2. The fomicatress and the fornicator,
flog each of them with a hundred stripes. Let
not pity withhold you in their case, in a punishment prescribed by Allah, if you believe in
Allah and the Last Day. And let a party of
the believers witness their punishment. (This
punishment is for unmarried persons guilty
of the above crime, but if married persons
commit it (illegal sex), the punishment is to
stone them to death, according to Allah's
Law).111
111 (V.24:2)
a) Narrated Abu Hurairah ....,, .ii 1 ~ ; : Allah's Messenger rl---J <,ii& .ii 1 ~ judged that the
unmarried person who was guilty of illegal sexual intercourse be exiled for one year and
receive the legal punishment (i.e., be flogged with one hundred stripes). (Sahih Al-Bukhari,

b) Narrated Jabir bin 'Abdullah Al-Ansari 4,,: .ii 1..ri'J: A man from the tribe of Bani Aslam

3. The adulterer-fornicator marries not
but an adulteress-fornicatress or a Mushrikah, and the adulteress-fornicatress none
marries her except an adulterer-fornicator or
a Muskrik [and that means that the man who
agrees to marry (have a sexual relation with)
a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan or
idolatress) or a prostitute, then surely he is
either an adulterer-fornicator, or a Mushrik
(polytheist, pagan or idolater). And the
woman who agrees to marry (have a sexual
relation with) a Mushrik {polytheist, pagan
or idolater) or an adulterer-fornicator, then
she is either a prostitute or a Mushrikah (female polytheist, pagan, or idolatress)]. Such
a thing is forbidden to the believers (of
Islamic Monotheism).
4. And those who accuse chaste women,
and produce not four witnesses, flog them
with eighty stripes, and reject their testimony
forever. They indeed are the Fdsiqun (liars,
rebellious, disobedient to Allah).

that he is one of those who speak the truth.

11. Verily those who brought forth the
slander (against 'A.ishah ~ ..ii 1 ~ J the wife of
the Prophet r!--J ~.ii,.;.,) are a group among
you. Consider it not a bad thing for you. Nay,
it is good for you. Unto every man among
them will be paid that which he had earned of
the sin, and as for him among them who had
the greater share therein, his will be a great
torment.
12. Why then, did not the believers, men
and women, when you heard it (the slander),
think good of their own P.eople and say: "This
(charge) is an obvious lie 111 ?"

13. Why did they not produce four
witnesses? Since they (the slanderers) have
not produced witnesses! Then with Allah they
are the liars.
14. Had it not been for the Grace of Allah
and His Mercy unto you in this world and in
the Hereafter, a great torment would have
touched you for that whereof you had spoken.
15. When you were propagating it with
your tongues, and uttering with your mouths
that whereof you had no knowledge, you
counted it a little thing, while with Allah it
was very great.
16. And why did you not, when you heard
it, say: "It is not right for us to speak of this.
Glory be to You (0 Allah)! This is a great
lie."

you not to repeat the like ofit forever, if you

Allah and His Mercy on you, (Allah would

And that Allah is full of Kindness, Most

footsteps of Shaitdn (Satan). And whosoever
follows the footsteps of Shaitdn (Satan), then,
verily he commands Al-Fahshd' [i.e. to
commit
indecency
(illegal
sexual
intercourse)], and Al-Munkar [disbelief and
polytheism (i.e. to do evil and wicked deeds;
and to speak or to do what is forbidden in
Islam)]. And had it not been for the Grace of
Allah and His Mercy on you, not one of you
would ever have been pure from sins. But
Allah purifies (guides to Islam) whom He

He has bestowed upon you. And force not
your maids to prostitution, if they desire
chastity, in order that you may make a gain in
the (perishable) goods of this worldly life. But
if anyone compels them (to prostitution), then
after such compulsion, Allah is Oft-Forgiving,
Most Merciful (to those women, i.e. He will
forgive them because they have been forced
to do this evil act unwillingly).
34. And indeed We have sent down for
you Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses, lessons,
signs, revelations, etc.) that make things
plain, and the example of those who passed
away before you, and an admonition for those
who are Al-Muttaqun (the pious - See
V.2:2).

35. Allah is the Light of the heavens and
the earth. The parable of His Light is as (if
there were) a niche and within it a lamp: the
lamp is in a glass, the glass as it were a
brilliant star, lit from a blessed tree, an olive,
neither of the east (i.e. neither it gets sun-rays
only in the morning) nor of the west (i.e. nor
it gets sun-rays only in the afternoon, but it is
exposed to the sun all day long), whose oil
would almost glow forth (of itself), though no
fire touched it. Light upon Light! Allah
guides to His Light whom He wills. And
Allah sets forth parables for mankind, and
Allah is AU-Knower of everything.
36. In houses (mosques) which Allah has
ordered to be raised (to be cleaned, and to be
honoured), in them His Name is remembered
[i.e. Adhan,
Iqamah, Saldt (prayers),
invocations, recitation of the Qur'an etc.].

(business) diverts from the Remembrance of
Allah (with heart and tongue), nor from
performing As-Sa/at (Jqamat-as-Salat), nor
from giving the Zakat. They fear a Day when
hearts and eyes will be overturned (out of the
horror of the torment of the Day of
Resurrection).

according to the best of their deeds, and add
even more for them out of His Grace. And
Allah provides without measure to whom He
wills. 11
39. As for those who disbelieve, their
deeds are like a mirage in a desert. The thirsty
one thinks it to be water, until he comes up to
it, he finds it to be nothing; but he finds Allah
with him, Who will pay him his due (Hell).
And Allah is Swift in taking account. 121
40. Or [the state of a disbeliever] is like
the darkness in a vast deep sea, overwhelmed
with waves topped by waves, topped by dark
clouds, (layers of) darkness upon darkness: if
a man stretches out his hand, he can hardly
see it! And he for whom Allah has not
appointed light, for him there is no light.

r'-J) that Allah, He it is Whom glorify
whosoever is in the heavens and the earth,
b) Narrated Abu Hurairah ow ...ii, ..,;,;: Allah's Messenger r'.J ",fL, .:U I J"". said: "The reward of
the Sa/at (prayer) offered by a person in congregation is multiplied twenty-five times as
much than that of the Sa/at (prayer) offered in one's house or in the market (alone). And
this is because if he performs ablution and does it perfectly and then proceeds to the
mosque, with the sole intention of praying: then for every step he takes towards the
mosque, he is upgraded one degree in reward and one of his sins is taken off (crossed
out) from his accounts (of deeds). When he offers his Sa/at (prayer), the angels keep on
asking All/:lh's Blessings and All/:lh's Forgiveness for him as long as he is (staying) at his
Musa/la (place of prayer). They say: 'O Allah! Bestow Your Blessings upon him, be merciful
and kind to him.' And one is regarded in Sa/at (prayer) as long as one is waiting for the
Sa/at (prayer)." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No.620).
111 (V.24:38) See the footnote of (V.9:121).
121 (V.24:39) The deeds of a disbeliever are like a mirage for a thirsty person: when he will
meet All/:lh, he will think that he has a good reward with All/:lh of his good deeds, but he will
find nothing, like a mirage, and will be thrown in the Fire of Hell.

nor any restriction on the lame, nor any
restriction on the sick, nor on yourselves, if
you eat from your houses, or the houses of
your fathers, or the houses of your mothers,
or the houses of your brothers, or the houses
of your sisters, or the houses of your father's
brothers, or the houses of your father's
sisters, or the houses of your mother's
brothers, or the houses of your mother's
sisters, or (from that) whereof you hold keys,
or (from the house) ofa friend. No sin on you
whether you eat together or apart. But when
you enter the houses, greet one another with a
greeting from Allah (i.e. say: ~ r")L...Jt
As-Saldmu 'Alaikum - peace be on you),
blessed and good. Thus Allah makes clear the
Aydt (these Verses or your religious symbols
and signs) to you that you may understand.

62. The true believers are only those, who
believe in (the Oneness of) Allah and His
Messenger (Muhammad r-'J ~.ii,,;..): and
when they are with him on some common
matter, they go not away until they have
asked his permission. Verily those who ask
your permission, those are they who (really)
believe in Allah and His Messenger. So if
they ask your permission for some affairs of
theirs, give permission to whom you will of
them, and ask Allah for their forgiveness.
Truly, Allah is Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.
63. Make not the calling of the Messenger
(Muhammad r-'J '-,!,I; .ii, ._,.J...) among you as
your calling one of another. Allah knows
those of you who slip away under shelter (of
some excuse without taking the permission to
leave, from the Messenger r-'J '-,!,I; .ii 1 ._,.J...).
And let those who oppose the Messenger's
(Muhammad r-'J '-,!,I; .ii, ._,.J...) commandment

beware, lest some Fitnah (disbelief, trials,
afflictions, earthquakes, killing, overpowered
by a tyrant) should befall them or a painful
torment be inflicted on them.

64. Certainly, to Allah belongs all that is
in the heavens and the earth. Surely, He
knows your condition and (He knows) the
Day when they will be brought back to Him,
then He will inform them of what they did.
And Allah is All-Knower of everything.

Slirat AI-Furq8n
(T.be Criterion) XXV
In the Name ofAllah
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.
1. Blessed be He Who sent down the
criterion (of right and wrong, i.e. this Qur'an)
to His slave (Muhammad ~J (,ii,: .ii 1 .fa) that
he may be a warner to the 'Alamin (mankind
and jinn).
2. He to Whom belongs the dominion of
the heavens and the earth, and Who has
begotten no son (children or offspring) and
for Whom there is no partner in the dominion.
He has created everything, and has measured
it exactly according to its due measurements.
3. Yet they have taken besides Him other
a/ihah (gods) who created nothing but are
themselves created, and possess neither harm
nor benefit for themselves, and possess no
power (of causing) death, nor (of giving) life,
nor of raising the dead.
4. Those who disbelieve say: "This (the
Qur' an) is nothing but a lie that he
(Muhammad r-1-'J ',!ls .ii, .fa) has invented, and
others have helped him at it. In fact they have
produced an unjust wrong (thing) and a lie."
5. And they say: "Tales of the ancients,
which he has written down: and they are
dictated to him morning and afternoon."

6. Say: "It (this Qur'an) has been sent
down by Him (Allah) (the Real Lord of the
heavens and earth) Who knows the secret of
the heavens and the earth. Truly, He is
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful."

7. And they say: "Why does this
Messenger (Muhammad r-1---'J ~ .:u 1 ..,.i..) eat
food, and walk about in the markets (as we).
Why is not an angel sent down to him to be a
wamer with him?
8. "Or (why) has not a treasure been
granted to him, or why has he not a garden
whereof he may eat?" And the Ztilimun
(polytheists and wrong-doers) say: "You
follow none but a man bewitched."

9. See how they coin similitudes for you,
so they have gone astray, and they cannot find
a (Right) Path.

~ :;,jS\iL:2::u;;~~ ~i

a,~.:iJ·.¥ -~~

10. Blessed be He Who, if He wills will
assign you better than (all) that- Gardens
under which rivers flow (Paradise) and will
assign you palaces (i.e. in Paradise).

11. Nay, they deny the Hour (the Day of
Resurrection), and for those who deny the
Hour, We have prepared a flaming Fire (i.e.
Hell).

12. When it (Hell) sees them from a far
place, they will hear its raging and its roaring.
13. And when they shall be thrown into a
narrow place thereof, chained together, they
will exclaim therein for destruction.
14. Exclaim not today for one destruction,

but exclaim for many destructions.
15. Say: (0 Muhammad

/'1-'J <.;J;> ..:»r .;..,) "Is

that (torment) better or the Paradise of Ete nity which is promised to the Muttaqun (the
pious - See V.2:2)?" It will be theirs as a
reward and as a final destination.

16. For them there will be therein all that
they desire, and they will abide (there
forever). It is a promise binding upon your
Lord that must be fulfilled.

17. And on the Day when He will gather
them together and that which they worship
besides Allah [idols, angels, pious men,
saints] 111 . He will say: "Was it you who misled these My slaves or did they (themselves)
stray from the (Right) Path?"

18. They will say: "Glorified be You! It
was not for us to take any Au/iyd' (Protectors,
Helpers) besides You, but You gave them and
their fathers comfort till they forgot the
warning, and became a lost people (doomed
to total loss).
19. Thus they (false gods - all deities
other than Allah) will belie you (polytheists)
regarding what you say (that they are gods
besides Allah): then you can neither avert (the
punishment), nor get help. And whoever
among you does wrong (i.e. sets up rivals to
Allah), We shall make him taste a great
torment.

Kill him not, perhaps he may be of benefit to
us, or we may adopt him as a son." And they
perceived not (the result of that).
10. And the heart of the mother of Musa
(Moses) became empty [from every thought,
except the thought of Musa (Moses)]. She
was very near to disclose his (case, i.e. the
child is her son), had We not strengthened her
heart (with Faith), so that she might remain as
one of the believers.
11. And she said to his [Musa's (Moses)]
sister: "Follow him." So she (his sister)
watched him from a far place secretly, while
they perceived not.

12. And We had already forbidden (other)
foster suckling mothers for him, until she (his
sister came up and) said: "Shall I direct you
to a household who will rear him for you, and
look after him in a good manner?"
13. So did We restore him to his mother,
that her eye might be comforted, and that she
might not grieve, and that she might know
that the Promise of Allah is true. But most of
them know not.
14. And when he attained his full strength,
and was perfect (in manhood), We bestowed
on him Hukm (Prophethood,
and right
judgement of the affairs) and religious
knowledge [of the religion of his forefathers
i.e. Islamic Monotheism]. And thus do We
reward the Muhsiniin (i.e. good doers. See the
footnote ofV.9:120).
15. And he entered the city at a time of
unawareness of its people: and he found there
two men fighting, - one of his party (his
religion - from the Children of Israel), and
the other of his foes. The man of his (own)
party asked him for help against his foe, so
Musa (Moses) struck him with his fist and
killed him. He said: "This is of Shaitan's
(Satan) doing: verily, he is a plain misleading
enemy."

18. So he became afraid, looking about in
the city (waiting as to what will be the result
of his crime of killing), when behold, the man
who had sought his help the day before,
called for his help (again). Musa (Moses) said
to him: "Verily, you are a plain misleader!"
19. Then when he decided to seize the
man who was an enemy to both of them, the
man said: "O Musa (Moses)! Is it your
intention to kill me as you killed a man
yesterday? Your aim is nothing but to become
a tyrant in the land, and not to be one of those
who do right."
20. And there came a man running, from
the farthest end of the city. He said: "O Musa
(Moses)! Verily, the chiefs are taking counsel
together about you, to kill you, so
escape.Truly, I am one of the good advisers
to you."

about in a state of fear. He said: "My Lord!
Save me from the people who are Zalimun

23. And when he arrived at the water (a

keeping back (their flocks). He said: "What is
the matter with you?" They said: "We cannot
water (our flocks) until the shepherds take
(their flocks). And our father is a very old
man."
24. So he watered (their flocks) for them,
then he turned back to shade, and said: "My
Lord! truly, I am in need of whatever good
that You bestow on me!"

25. Then there came to him one of the two
women, walking shyly. She said: "Verily, my
father calls you that he may reward you for
having watered (our flocks) for us." So when
he came to him and narrated the story, he
said: "Fear you not. You have escaped from
the people who are Zalimun (polytheists,
disbelievers, and wrong-doers)."
26. And said one of them (the two
women): "O my father! Hire him! Verily, the
best of men for you to hire is the strong, the
trustworthy."

27. He said: "I intend to wed one of these
two daughters of mine to you, on condition
that you serve me for eight years; but if you
complete ten years, it will be (a favour) from
you. But I intend not to place you under a
difficulty. If Allah wills, you will find me one
of the righteous."
28. He [Musa (Moses)] said: "That (is
settled) between me and you: whichever of
the two terms I fulfil, there will be no
injustice to me, and Allah is Surety over what
we say."
29. Then, when Musa (Moses) had
fulfilled the term, and was travelling with his
family, he saw a fire in the direction of Tur
(Mount). He said to his family: "Wait, I have
seen a fire; perhaps I may bring you from
there some information, or a burning
fire-brand that you may warm yourselves."

30. So when he reached it (the fire), he
was called from the right side of the valley, in
the blessed place, from the tree: "O Musa
(¥oses)! Verily I am Allah, the Lord of the
'Alamin (mankind, jinn and all that exists)!
31. "And throw your stick!" But when he
saw it moving as if it were a snake, he turned
in flight, and looked not back. (It was said:)
"O Musa (Moses)! Draw near, and fear not.
Verily, you are of those who are secure.

32. "Put your hand in your bosom, it will
come forth white without a disease; and draw
your hand close to your side to be free from

and also your hand will return to its original

they are the people who are Fdsiqun

33. He said: "My Lord! I have killed a

me.
34. "And my brother Hfuiin (Aaron)- he
is more eloquent in speech than me: so send
him with me as a helper to confirm me. Verily
I fear that they will belie me."
35. Allah said: "We will strengthen your
arm through your brother, and give you both

the Fire: and on the Day of Resurrection, they
will not be helped.
42. And We made a curse to follow them
in this world, and on the Day of Resurrection,
they will be among Al-Maqbuhun (those who
are prevented from receiving Allah's Mercy
or any good; despised or destroyed).
43. And indeed We gave Musa (Moses)
- after We had destroyed the generations of
old - the Scripture [the Taurat (Torah)] as
an enlightenment for mankind, and a
guidance and a mercy, that they might
remember (or receive admonition).
44. And you (0 Muhammad r-1:,-J ~ .jJ, ~ )
were not on the western side (of the Mount),
when We made clear to Musa (Moses) the
commandment, and you were not among the
witnesses.
45. But We created generations [after
generations i.e. after Musa (Moses) r:il-J' ~],
and long were the ages that passed over them.
And you (0 Muhammad r!-J ~ .jJ, ~ ) were
not a dweller among the people ofMadyan
(Midian), reciting Our Verses to them. But it
is We Who kept sending (Messengers).
46. And you (0 Muhammad r!--J ~ .jJ 1 ~ )
were not at the side of the Tfu (Mount) when
We did call: [it is said that Allah called the
followers of Muhammad r!-J ..,i., .jJ, ~ , and

Musa (Moses)]. But (you are sent) as a mercy
from your Lord, to give warning to a people
to whom no warner had come before you: in
order that they may remember or receive
admonition. [Taftir At-Tabari].

47. And if (We had) not (sent you to the
people of Makkah) - in case a calamity
should seize them for (the deeds) that their
hands have sent forth, they would have said:
"Our Lord! Why did You not send us a

Did they not disbelieve in that which was

"Two kinds of magic [the Taurat (Torah) and
the Qur'an], each helping the other!" And
they say: "Verily in both we are disbelievers."

49. Say (to them, 0 Muhammad .:u 1 ~

which is a better guide than these two [the

bring the Book nor believe in your doctrine of
Islamic Monotheism), then know that they
only follow their own lusts. And who is more
astray than one who follows his own lusts,
without guidance from Allah? Verily Allah
guides not the people who are Zalimiin

Abu Talib! Will you leave the religion of 'Abdul Muttalib?" So they kept on
saying this to him so that the last statement he said to them (before he died) was: "I am on
the religion of 'Abdul Muttalib." Then the Prophet r-1-'.J ~ .ii 1 ~ said: "I will keep on asking
for Allah's Forgiveness for you unless I am forbidden to do so." Then the following Verse
was revealed: "It is not proper for the Prophet and those who believe to ask Allah's
Forgiveness for the Mushrik(m even though they be of kin, after it has become clear to
them that they are the dwellers of the (Hell) Fire (because they died in a state of disbelief)."

(Moses) people, but he behaved arrogantly
towards them. And We gave him of the
treasures, that of which the keys would have
been a burden to a body of strong men.
Remember when his people said to him: "Do
not exult (with riches, being ungrateful to

(with riches, being ungrateful to Allah).
77. "But seek, with that (wealth) which
Allah has bestowed on you, the home of the

lawful enjoyment in this world; and do good
as Allah has been good to you, and seek not
mischief in the land. Verily, Allah likes not
the Mufsidiin (those who commit great crimes
and sins, oppressors, tyrants, mischief-makers,
corrupters). "
78. He said: "This has been given to me
only because of the knowledge I possess."

stronger than him in might and greater in the

they will be punished without being called to

life of the world, said: "Ah, would that we
had the like of what Qarun (Korab) has been

2. Do people think that they will be left
alone because they say: "We believe," and
will not be tested.

3. And We indeed tested those who were
before them. And Allah will certainly make
(it) known (the truth of) those who are true,
and will certainly make (it) known (the
falsehood of) those who are liars, (although
Allah knows all that before putting them to

4. Or think those who do evil deeds that
they can outstrip Us (i.e. escape Our
punishment)? Evil is that which they judge!
S. Whoever hopes for the Meeting111 with
Allah, then Allah's Term is surely coming
and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Knower.

6. And whosoever strives, he strives only
for himself. Verily, Allah stands not in need
of any of the 'Alamin (mankind, jinn, and all

Allah (Monotheism) and in Messenger

strive to make you join with Me (in worship)

10. Of mankind are some who say: "We

suffer for the sake of Allah, they consider the
trial of mankind as Allah's punishment; and if
victory comes from your Lord, (the
hypocrites) will say: "Verily we were with
you (helping you)." Is not Allah Best Aware
of what is in the breasts of the 'Alamin

11. Verily, Allah knows those who
believe, and verily, He knows the hypocrites

hard days to discriminate the good from the
wicked, although Allah knows all that before

12. And those who disbelieve say to those
who believe: "Follow our way and we will
verily bear your sins." Never will they bear
anything of their sins. Surely, they are liars.

Allah will bring forth the creation of the

That is best for those who seek Allah's
Countenance; and it is they who will be
successful.

that they raise clouds, and spread them along

them fall on whom of His slaves as He wills,
lo, they rejoice!

before it was sent down upon them - they

Allah's Mercy: how He revives the earth after its
death. Verily, that (Allah) (Who revived the

they ever deluded [away from the truth (i.e.
they used to tell lies and take false oaths, and
tum away from the truth) in this life of the

56. And those who have been bestowed
with knowledge and faith will say: "Indeed
you have stayed according to the Decree of
Allah, until the Day of Resurrection: so this is
the Day of Resurrection, but you knew not."
57. So on that Day no excuse of theirs will
avail those who did wrong (by associating
partners in worship with Allah, and by
denying the Day of Resurrection), nor will
they be allowed (then) to return to seek
Allah's Pleasure (by having Islamic Faith
with righteous deeds and by giving up

4. Allfill it is He Who has created the

Majesty). You (mankind) have none, besides
Him, as a Wali (protector or helper) or an

In the Name ofAllah
the Most Gracious, the Most Merciful.

1. 0 Prophet (Muhammad r1-J ~ .ii 1.,.i..,)!
Keep your duty to Allah, and obey not the
disbelievers and the hypocrites (i.e., do not follow
their advice). Verily, Allah is Ever All-Knower,
All-Wise.
2. And follow that which is revealed to
you from your Lord. Verily, Allah is
Well-Acquainted with what you do.
3. And put your trust in Allah, and
Sufficient is Allah as a Wakil (Trustee or
Disposer of affairs).
4. Allah has not made for any man two
hearts inside his body. Neither has He made
your wives whom you declare to be like your
mothers' backs, your real mothers [Az-Zihar
is the saying of a husband to his wife, "You
are to me like the back of my mother" i.e.
You are unlawful for me to approach],'11 nor
has He made your adopted sons your real
sons. That is but your saying with your
mouths. But Allah says the truth, and He
guides to the (Right) Way.
5. Call them (adopted sons) by (the names
of) their fathers: that is more just with Allah.
But if you know not their father' s (names, call
them) your brothers in faith and Mawalikum
(your freed slaves). And there is no sin on
you concerning that in which you made a
mistake'2' , except in regard to what your
hearts deliberately intend. And Allah is Ever
Oft-Forgiving, Most Merciful.

other have closer personal ties in the Decree
of Allah (regarding inheritance) than (the
brotherhood of) the believers and the

that you do kindness to those brothers (when
the Prophet r-'J ~ .ii , ~ joined them in
brotherhood ties). This has been written in the
(Allah's Book of Divine) Decrees (Al-Lauh Al-Mahfuz)."

7. And (remember) when We took from
the Prophets their covenant, and from you (0
Muhammad r-'J ~.ii,~), and from Nub
(Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses),
and 'Isa (Jesus) son of Maryam f:Mary). We
took from them a strong covenant. 21
8. That He may ask the truthful (Allah's
Messengers and His Prophets) about their
truth (i.e. the conveyance of Allah's Message
that which they were charged with). And He
has prepared for the disbelievers a painful
torment (Hell-fire).
9. 0 you who believe! Remember Allah's
Favour to you, when there came against you
hosts, and We sent against them a wind and
forces that you saw not [i.e. troops of angels

"Come here towards us," while they
(themselves) come not to the battle except a

their eyes revolving like (those of) one over

departs, they will smite you with sharp
tongues, miserly towards (spending anything
in any) good (and only covetous of booty and
wealth). Such have not believed. Therefore
Allah makes their deeds fruitless and that is
ever easy for Allah.

20. They think that Al-Ahzab (the
Confederates) have not yet withdrawn; and if
AI-Ahzab (the Confederates) should come
(again), they would wish they were in the

Then he advanced and Sa'd bin Mu'adh met him. He said "O Sa'd bin Mu'adh! By the Lord

display yourselves like that of the times of

Islamic Monotheism), the men and the

"(Prophet) Musa (Moses) was a shy person and used to cover his body completely 6ecause
of his extensive shyness. One of the Children of Israel annoyed him by saying, 'He covers
his body in this way only because of some defect in his skin, either leprosy or scrotal
hernia, or he had some other defect.' Allah wished to clear Musa (Moses) of what they said
about him: so one day while Musa (Moses) was in seclusion, he took off his clothes and put
them on a stone and started taking a bath. When he had finished the bath, he moved
towards his clothes so as to take them, but the stone took his clothes and fled. Musa
(Moses) picked up his stick and ran after the stone saying, 'O stone! give me my clothes!'
till he reached a group of Bani Israel who saw him naked then, and found him the best of
what Allah had created; and Allah cleared him of what they had accused him of. The stone
stopped there and Musa (Moses) took and put his garment on and started hitting the stone

you; not even the weight of an atom (or a
small ant) or less than that or greater escapes
His Knowledge in the heavens or in the earth
but it is in a Clear Book (Al-lauh

4. That He may recompense those who
believe (in the Oneness of Allah -lslfunic
Monotheism) and do righteous good deeds.
Those, theirs is forgiveness and Rizq Karim
(generous provision, i.e. Paradise).

5. But those who strive against Our Ayat
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.) to frustrate them - those,
for them will be a severe painful torment. 111

(making) high rooms, images, basins as large
as reservoirs, and (cooking) cauldrons fixed
(in their places). "Work you, 0 family of

of the earth which kept (slowly) gnawing

jinn saw clearly that if they had known the

humiliating torment.

sign in their dwelling-place - two gardens
on the right hand and on the left; (and it was
said to them:) "Eat of the provision of your
Lord, and be grateful to Him." A fair land and
an Oft-Forgiving Lord!
16. But they turned away (from the
obedience of Allfth), so We sent against them
Sail Al- 'Arim (flood released from the dam),
and We converted their two gardens into
gardens producing bitter bad fruit, and
tamarisks, and some few lote-trees.

17. Like this We requited them because
they were ungrateful disbelievers. And never
do We requite in such a way except those who
are ungrateful (disbelievers).
18. And We placed, between them and the

And no female conceives or gives birth but
with His Knowledge. And no aged man is

Oneness of Allah - Islamic Monotheism),
for them will be the Fire of Hell. Neither will
it have a complete killing effect on them so
that they die, nor shall its torment be
lightened for them. Thus do We requite every

37. Therein they will cry: "Our Lord!
Bring us out, we shall do righteous good
deeds, not (the evil deeds) that we used to

lives long enough, so that whosoever would
receive admonition could receive it? And the

41. Verily! Allah grasps the heavens and
the earth lest they should move away from
their places, and if they were to move away
from their places, there is not one that could
grasp them after Him. Tru!t1• He is Ever Most
Forbearing, Oft-Forgiving. 1
42. And they swore by Allah their most
binding oath that if a warner came to them,
they would be more guided than any of the
nations (before them); yet when a wamer
(Muhammad iJ-,., ~ ..ii 1..,..i..,) came to them, it
increased in them nothing but flight (from the
truth).
43. (They took to flight because of their)
arrogance in the land and their plotting of
evil. But the evil plot encompasses only him
who makes it. Then, can they expect anything
(else) but the Sunnah (way of dealing) ofthe
peoples of old? So no change will you find in
Allah's Sunnah (way of dealing}, and no
turning off will you find in Allah's Sunnah
(way of dealing).
44. Have they not travelled in the land,
and seen what was the end of those before
them - though they were superior to them in
power? Allah is not such that anything in the
heavens or in the earth escapes Him. Verily,
He is All-Knowing, All-Omnipotent.
45. And if Allah were to punish men for
that which they earned, He would not leave a
moving (living) creature on the surface of the
earth; but He gives them respite to an
appointed term: and when their term comes,
then verily, Allah is Ever All-Seer of His
slaves.

Verily, He is the All-Knower of that which is

8. And when some hurt touches man, he
cries to his Lord (Allah Alone), turning to
Him in repentance. But when He bestows a
favour upon him from Himself, he forgets that
for which he cried for before, and he sets up
rivals to Allah, in order to mislead others
from His Path. Say: "Take pleasure in your
disbelief for a while: surely you are (one) of
the dwellers of the Fire!"
9. Is one who is obedient to Allah,
prostrating himself or standing (in prayer)
during the hours of the night, fearing the
Hereafter and hoping for the Mercy of his
Lord (like one who disbelieves)? Say: "Are
those who know equal to those who know
not?" It is only men of understanding who
will remember (i.e. get a lesson from Allah's
Signs and Verses).

their families on the Day of Resurrection.

thereby produces crops of different colours,

26. So Allah made them to taste the
disgrace in the present life, but greater is the
torment of the Hereafter if they only knew!
27. And indeed We have put forth for
men, in this Qur'an every kind of similitude
in order that they may remember.

28. An Arabic Qur'an, without any
crookedness (therein) in order that they may
avoid all evil which Allah has ordered them
to avoid, fear Him and keep their duty to
Him.
29. Allah puts forth a similitude: a (slave)
man belonging to many partners (like those
who worship others along with Allah)
disputing with one another, and a (slave) man
belonging entirely to one master (like those
who worship Allah Alone). Are those two
equal in comparison? All the praises and
thanks be to Allah! But most of them know
not.
30. Verily you (0 Muhammad~ .li 1 _,i..,

18. And warn them (0 Muhammad .:ii,~

ri-J "-,!ls) of the Day that is drawing near (i.e.
the Day of Resurrection), when the hearts will
be choking the throats, and they can neither
return them (hearts) to their chests nor can
they throw them out. There will be no friend,
nor an intercessor for the Zdlimun
(polytheists and wrong-doers), who could be
given heed to.

19. Allah knows the fraud of the eyes, and
all that the breasts conceal.
20. And Allah judges with truth, while
those to whom they invoke besides Him,
cannot judge anything. Certainly, Allah! He is
the All-Hearer, the All-Seer.
21. Have they not travelled in the land and
seen what was the end of those who were
before them? They were superior to them in
strength, and in the traces (which they left) in
the land. But Allah seized them with
punishment for their sins. And none had they
to protect them from Allah.

22. That was because there came to them
their Messengers with clear evidences (proofs
and signs) but they disbelieved (in them). So
Allah seized them (with punishment). Verily
He is All-Strong, Severe in punishment.
23. And indeed We sent Musa (Moses)
with Our Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses,
lessons, signs, revelations, etc.), and a
manifest authority,
24. To Fir'aun (Pharaoh),

Haman and

Qarun (Korab), but they called (him): "A
sorcerer, a liar!"
25. Then, when he brought them the Truth
from Us, they said: "Kill the sons of those
who believe with him and let their women
live"; but the plots of disbelievers are nothing
but in vain!

(to stop me from killing him)! I fear that he

cause mischief to appear in the land!"
27. Musa (Moses) said: "Verily I seek
refuge in my Lord and your Lord from every
arrogant who believes not in the Day of
Reckoning!"
28. And a believing man of Fir'aun's
(Pharaoh) family, who hid his faith said:
"Would you kill a man because he says: My
Lord is Allah, and he has come to you with
clear signs (proofs) from your Lord? And if
he is a liar, upon him will be (the sin of) his
lie; but ifhe is telling the truth, then some of
that (calamity) wherewith he threatens you
will befall on you." Verily, Allah guides not
one who is a Musrif (a polytheist, or a
murderer who shed blood without a right, or
those who commit great sins, oppressor,
transgressor), a liar!
29. "O my people! Yours is the kingdom
today, you being dominant in the land. But
who will save us from the Torment of Allah,
should it befall us?" Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said:
"I show you only that which I see (correct),
and I guide you only to the path of right
policy!"
30. And he who believed said: "O my
people! Verily, I fear for you a fate like that
day (of disaster) of the Confederates (of old)!
31. "Like the fate of the people ofNfih
(Noah}, and 'Ad, and Thamfid and those who
came after them. And Allah wills no injustice
for (His) slaves.

34. And indeed Yusuf (Joseph) did come
to you, in times gone by, with clear signs, but
you ceased not to doubt in that which he did
bring to you: till when he died you said: "No
Messenger will Allah send after him." Thus
Allah leaves astray him who is a Musrif (a
polytheist, an oppressor, a criminal, sinner
who commit great sins) and a Murtdb (one
who doubts Allah's Warning and His
Oneness).
35. Those who dispute about the Aydt
(proofs, evidences, verses, lessons, signs,
revelations, etc.) of Allah, without any
authority that has come to them, it is greatly
hateful and disgusting to Allah and to those
who believe. Thus does Allah seal up the
heart of every arrogant, tyrant. (So they
cannot guide themselves to the Right Path).

36. And Fir'aun (Pharaoh) said: "O
Haman! Build me a tower that I may arrive at

look upon the Ildh (God) of Musa (Moses):

was hindered from the (Right) Path; and the
plot of Fir'aun (Pharaoh) led to nothing but
loss and destruction (for him).
38. And the man who believed said: "O
my people! Follow me, I will guide you to the
way ofright conduct [i.e. guide you to Allah's

Musa (Moses) has been sent].

"Worship none but AIHl.h", they said: "If our

mightier than us in strength?" See they not
that Allah Who created them was mightier in

give them a taste of disgracing torment in this
present worldly life. But surely the torment of

the torment) is justified against them as it was
justified against those who were among the
previous generations of jinn and men that had
passed away before them. Indeed they (all)
were the losers.
26. And those who disbelieve say: "Listen
not to this Qur'an, and make noise in the
midst of its (recitation) that you may
overcome."

27. But surely, We shall cause those who
disbelieve to taste a severe torment, and
certainly, We shall requite them the worst of
what they used to do.
28. That is the recompense of the enemies
of Allah: the Fire. Therein will be for them

them under our feet so that they become the

30. Verily, those who say: "Our Lord is
Allah (Alone)," and then they stand firm, 111 on

34. The good deed and the evil deed
cannot be equal. Repel (the evil) with one

c) Narrated Abu Musa ~ .,ji 1 ~ ; : The Prophet rL-, ~ .,ji 1 ~ said, "The example of
Muslims, Jews and Christians is like the example of a man who employed labourers to work
for him from morning till night for specific wages. They worked till mid-day and then said,
'We do not need your money which you have fixed for us and let whatever we have done be
annulled.' The man said to them, 'Don't quit the work, but complete the rest of it and take
your full wages.' But they refused and went away (like the Jews who refused to believe in
the Message of Jesus r::,I...JI .,.i.. ). The man employed another batch after them and said to
them, 'Complete the rest of the day and yours will be the wages I had fixed for the first
batch.· So, they worked till the time of 'Asr prayer. They said, 'Let what we have done be
annulled and keep the wages you have promised us for yourself!' The man said to them,
'Complete the rest of the work, as only a little of the day remains': but they refused (like the
Christians who refused to believe in the Message of Muhammad ,-J:-, ..i.. ..li I J-.,). Thereafter,
he employed another batch to work for the rest of the day and they worked for the rest of
the day till the sunset, and they received the wages of the two former batches. So that was
the example of these people (Muslims) and the example of this light [Islamic Monotheism,
the Qur'an, the Sunnah (legal ways of the Prophet rt:'., "'"' .,ji 1 ..;..,) and the guidance which
Prophet Muhammad rL:-, ~ .,ji 1 ~ brought] which they have accepted willingly."* (Sahih
Al-Bukhari, Vol. 3, Hadith No. 471)
• The Jews refused to believe in the Message of 'isa (Jesus), so all their work was
annulled; similarly, the Christians refused to accept the Message of Muhammad ..,.i.. .,ji 1 ..,i..,
r-1--:'., and thus their work was annulled too. Such people were not rewarded, because they
refused to have true faith for the rest of their lives and died as disbelievers. They should
have believed in the latest Message; for their insistence on keeping their old religion
deprived them of the reward which they would have got for their previous good deeds
achieved before the advent of the new religion. On the other hand, Muslims accepted and
believed in all the three Messages and deserved a full reward for their complete surrender
to Allah (AI-Qastalani, Vol. 4, Page 133).

47. To Him (Alone) is referred the
knowledge of the Hour.11 1No fruit comes out
of its sheath, nor does a female conceive nor
brings forth (young), except by His
Knowledge. And on the Day when He will
call unto them (polytheists) (saying): "Where

poverty or disease, etc.) has touched him, he

But if I am brought back to my Lord, surely,
there will be for me the best (wealth) with
Him. Then, We verily, will show to the
disbelievers what they have done, and We

38. And those who answer the Call of
their Lord [i.e. to believe that He is the only
One Lord (Allah), and to worship none but
Him
Alone],
and perform As-Sa/at
(lqdmat-as-Saldt), and who (conduct) their
affairs by mutual consultation, and who spend
of what We have bestowed on them.

39. And those who, when an oppressive
wrong is done to them, take revenge.
40. The recompense for an evil is an evil
like thereof; but whoever forgives and makes
reconciliation, his reward is with Allah.
Verily, He likes not the Zdlimiin (oppressors,
polytheists, and wrong-doers).

41. And indeed whosoever takes revenge
after he has suffered wrong, for such there is
no way (of blame) against them.

those who oppress men and rebel in the earth
without justification; for such there will be a
painful torment.

for him there is no Wali (protector, helper,

46. And they will have no Auliyd'

sends astray, for him there is no way.
47. Answer the Call of your Lord (i.e.

Day which cannot be averted (i.e. the Day of
Resurrection). You will have no refuge on

some ill befalls them because of the deeds

15. Yet, they assign to some of His slaves

16. Or has He taken daughters out of what
He has created, and He has selected for you

19. And they make the angels who
themselves are slaves of the Most Gracious
(Allah) females. Did they witness their
creation? Their testimony will be recorded,
and they will be questioned!

20. And they said: "If it had been the Will
of the Most Gracious (Allah), we should not
have worshipped them (false deities)." They
have no knowledge whatsoever of that. They
do nothing but lie!
21. Or have We given them any Book
before this (the Qur'an) to which they are
holding fast?

22. Nay! They say: "We found our fathers
following a certain way and religion, and we
guide ourselves by their footsteps."
23. And similarly, We sent not a wamer

will indeed follow their footsteps."

found your fathers following?" They said:
"Verily, we disbelieve in that with which you
have been sent."

25. So We took revenge on them, then see
what was the end of those who denied
(Islamic Monotheism).
26. And (remember) when Ibrahim
(Abraham) said to his father and his people:
"Verily, I am innocent of what you worship,

27. "Except Him (i.e. I worship none but
Allah Alone) Who did create me; and verily
He will guide me."
28. And he made it [i.e. La ilaha illallah
(none has the right to be worshipped but
Allah Alone)] a Word lasting among his
offspring (True Monotheism), that they may
turn back (i.e. to repent to Allah or receive
admonition).
29. Nay, but I gave (the good things of
this life) to these (polytheists) and their
fathers to enjoy, till there came to them the
truth (the Qur'an), and a Messenger
(Muhammad r-1--,"""'"' .111 _,-L.,) making things
clear.
30. And when the truth (this Qur'an) came
to them, they (the disbelievers in this Qur'an)
said: "This is magic, and we disbelieve
therein."
31. And they say: "Why is not this Qur'an
sent down to some great man of the two
towns (Makkah and Ta'if)?"

32. ls it they who would portion out the
Mercy of your Lord? It is We Who portion
out between them their livelihood in this
world, and We raised some of them above
others in ranks, so that some may employ
others in their work. But the Mercy (Paradise)
of your Lord (0 Muhammad r-1-, ~ .ll I J-,,) is
better than the (wealth of this world) which
they amass.
33. And were it not that mankind would
have become of one community (all

would have provided for those who disbelieve
in the Most Gracious (Allah), silver roofs for
their houses, and elevators whereby they
ascend,
34. And for their houses, doors (of silver),
and thrones (of silver) on which they could
recline,
35. And adornments of gold. Yet all this
(i.e. the roofs, doors, stairs, elevators, thrones
of their houses) would have been nothing but
an enjoyment of this world. And the Hereafter
with your Lord is (only) for the Muttaqun. 111
36. And whosoever turns away blindly
from the remembrance of the Most Gracious
(Allah) (i.e. this Qur'an and worship of
Allah), We appoint for him Shaitan (Satan devil) to be a Qarin (a companion) to him.

37. And verily, they (Satans / devils)
hinder them from the Path (of Allah), but they
think that they are guided aright!
38. Till, when (such a one) comes to Us,
he says [to his Qarin (Satan / devil
companion)] "Would that between me and
you were the distance of the two easts (or the
east and west)" a worst (type of)
companion (indeed)!
39. It will profit you not this Day (0 you
who turn away from Allah's remembrance
and His worship) as you did wrong, (and) that
you will be sharers (you and your Qarin) in
the punishment.

40. Can you (0 Muhammad /'1-J ~ ..ii 1 _;..,)

blind or him who is in manifest error?

(that they will believe if We remove the

among his people (saying): "O my people! Is
not mine the dominion of Egypt, and these
rivers flowing underneath me. See you not

55. So when they angered Us, We
punished them, and drowned them all.
56. And We made them a precedent (as a
lesson for those coming after them), and an

57. And when the son of Maryam (Mary)
is quoted as an example [i.e. 'Isa (Jesus) is
worshipped like their idols], behold, your
people cry aloud (laugh out at the example).
58. And say: "Are our alihah (gods) better
or is he ['Isa (Jesus))?" They quoted not the
above example except for argument. Nay! But
they are a quarrelsome people. (See V.

slave. We granted Our Favour to him, and
We made him an example for the Children of

Therefore have no doubt concerning it (i.e.

65. But the sects from among themselves
differed. So woe to those who do wrong [by
ascribing things to 'Isa (Jesus) that are not
true) from the torment ofa painful Day (i.e.

66. Do they only wait for the Hour that it

29. This Our Record speaks about you
with truth. Verily, We were recording what
you used to do (i.e. Our angels used to record
your deeds).

Nay, but they vanished completely from them

"Listen in silence!" And when it was finished,

1. Those who disbelieve (in the Oneness
of Allah, and in the Message of Prophet
Muhammad ,-J-J ~ .ii, ..;. ), and hinder (men)
from the Path of Allah (lslamic1Monotheism),
He will render their deeds vain. W

2. But those who believe and do righteous
good deeds, and believe in that which is sent
down to Muhammad (,-J-J ~ .ii 1..;.) - for it
is the truth from their Lord - He will expiate
from them their sins, and will make good
their state.
3. That is because those who disbelieve
follow falsehood, while those who believe
follow the truth from their Lord. Thus does
Allah set forth for mankind their parables.

4. So, when you meet (in fight - Jihad in
Allah's Cause) those who disbelieve, smite
(their) necks till when you have killed and
wounded many of them, then bind a bond
firmly (on them, i.e. take them as captives).
Thereafter (is the time) either for generosity
(i.e. free them without ransom), or ransom
(according to what benefits Islam), until the
war lays down its burden. Thus [you are
ordered by Allah to continue in carrying out
Jihad against the disbelievers till they
embrace Islam and are saved from the
punishment in the Hell-fire or at least come

27. Then how (will it be) when the angels
will take their souls at death, smiting their
faces and their backs?
28. That is because they followed that
which angered Allah and hated that which
pleased Him. So He made their deeds
fruitless.

not bring to light all their hidden ill-wills? 1

30. Had We willed, We could have shown
them to you, and you should have known
them by their marks; but surely, you will
know them by the tone of their speech! And
Allah knows (all) your deeds.

test those who strive hard (for the Cause of
Allah) and As-Scibirun (the patient), and We
shall test your facts (i.e. the one who is a liar,

example of guidance and knowledge (the Qur'an and the Sunnah) with which Allah has sent
me, is like abundant rain falling on the earth, some of which was fertile soil that absorbed
rain water and brought forth vegetation and grass in abundance. (And) another portion of it
was hard and held the rain water and Allah benefited the people with it and they utilized it
for drinking, making their animals drink from it and irrigating the land for cultivation. (And) a
portion of it was barren which could neither hold the water nor bring forth vegetation (then
that land gave no benefits). The first is the example of the person who comprehends Allah's
religion (Islam) and gets benefit (from the knowledge) which Allah ~ 3 r has revealed
through me (the Prophet r-'J ~ .ii 1 _;..,) and learns and then teaches it to others. The last
example is that of a person who does not care for it and does not take Allah's Guidance
revealed through me: (He is like that barren land)." (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.1, Hadith No.79).

least, but He will make their deeds fiuitless,

34. Verily, those who disbelieve, and
hinder (men) from the Path of Allah (i.e.
Islam); then die while they are disbelievers Allah will not forgive them. 111

35. So be not weak and ask not for peace
(from the enemies of Islam) while you are
having the upper hand. Allfill is with you, and
He will never decrease the reward ofyour
good deeds.
36. The life of this world is but play and
pastime; but if you believe (in the Oneness of
Allah Islamic Monotheism), and fear
Allah, and avoid evil, He will grant you your
wages, and will not ask you your wealth.
37. If He were to ask you ofit, and press
you, you would covetously withhold, and He
will bring out all your (secret) ill-wills.
38. Behold! You are those who are called
to spend in the Cause of Allfill, yet among you
are some who are niggardly. And whoever is
niggardly, it is only at the expense of his
ownself. But Allah is Rich (Free of all needs),
and you (mankind) are poor. And if you turn
away (from Islam and the obedience to
Allah), He will exchange you for some other
people and they will not be your likes.

a) Guidance of Taufiq and it is totally from Allah, i.e. Allah opens one's heart to receive the
truth (from disbelief to Belief in Islamic Monotheism).
b) Guidance of lrsMd i.e. through preaching by Allah's Messengers and pious preachers
who preach the truth i.e. Islamic Monotheism.

those of them who disbelieved with painful
torment.
26. When those who disbelieve had put in
their hearts pride and haughtiness - the pride
and haughtiness of the time of ignorance, then Allah sent down His Sakinah (calmness
and tranquillity) upon His Messenger ( .ii 1 ~

them stick to the word of piety (i.e. none has

which He showed to His Messenger(.:» 1.,JrJ,-, ~) [i.e. the Prophet ri-, 4P .:» 1.,J- saw a

you shall enter AI-Masjid- al-Haram, if Allah
wills,

shaved, and (some) having your head hair cut
short, having no fear. He knew what you

28. He it is Who has sent His Messenger
(Muhammad ri-, 4P .:» 1 .,J-) with guidance and
the religion of truth (Islam), that He may
make it (Islam) superior to all religions. And
All-Sufficient is Allah as a Witness.
29. Muhammad (r1-, ._,.ip .:» 1..,-J,-,) is the
Messenger of Allah. And those who are with
him are severe against disbelievers, and
merciful among themselves. You see them
bowing and falling down prostrate (in
prayer), seeking Bounty from Allah and (His)
Good Pleasure. The mark of them (i.e. of
their Faith) is on their faces (foreheads) from
the traces of prostration (during prayers).
This is their description in the Taurat (Torah).
But their description in the lnjeel (Gospel) is
like a (sown) seed which sends forth its shoot,
then makes it strong, and becomes thick and it
stands straight on its stem, delighting the
sowers, that He may enrage the disbelievers
with them. Allah has promised those among
them who believe (i.e. all those who follow
Islamic Monotheism, the religion of Prophet
Muhammad ,.i-, ~ .:» 1 _,.i... till the Day of
Resurrection) and do righteous good deeds,
forgiveness and a mighty reward (i.e.
Paradise).

to obey you (i.e. follow your opinions and

and the other used to go about with calumnies (among the people to rouse hostilities, e.g.,
one goes to a person and tells him that so-and-so says about him such and such evil
things)." The Prophet ,1-J <,i.t. .iJ I J..o then asked for a green branch of a date-palm tree, split
it into two pieces and planted one on each grave and said, "It is hoped that their

**A Qattat is a person who conveys disagreeable, false information from one person to

Allah (for reduction) and He made it forty. I returned and [met Musa] and had a similar
discussion, and then returned again to Allah for reduction and He made it thirty, then
twenty, then ten; and then I came to Musa who repeated the same advice. Ultimately Allah
reduced it to five. When I came to Musa again, he said, 'What have you done?' I said,

2. Those among you who make their
wives unlawful to them by (Zihar }+1.Jl)111
(i.e. by saying to them "You are like my
mother's back,") they cannot be their
mothers. None can be their mothers except
those who gave them birth. And verily, they
utter an ill word and a lie. And verily, Allah is
Oft-Pardoning, Oft-Forgiving.
3. And those who make unlawful to them
their wives by Zihar and wish to free
themselves from what they uttered, (the
penalty) in that case is the freeing of a slave
before they touch each other. That is an
admonition to you (so that you may not repeat
such an ill thing). And Allah is All-Aware of
what you do.

4. And he who finds not (the money for
freeing a slave) must fast two successive
months before they both touch each other.
And he who is unable to do so, should feed
sixty Miskins (poor). That is in order that you
may have perfect Faith in Allah and His
Messenger. These are the limits set by Allah.
And for disbelievers, there is a painful
torment.

His Knowledge, while He Himself is over the
Throne, over the seventh heaven), nor of five
but He is their sixth (with His Knowledge),
nor of less than that or more but He is with
them (with His Knowledge) wheresoever they
may be. And afterwards on the Day of
Resurrection He will inform them of what
they did. Verily, Allah is the All-Knower of

8. Have you not seen those who were
forbidden to hold secret counsels, and
afterwards returned to that which they had
been forbidden, and conspired together for
sin and wrong doing and disobedience to the
Messenger (Muhammad rl--J '4L> .:ii I J-.,). And
when they come to you, they greet you with a
greeting wherewith Allah greets you not, and
say within themselves: "Why should Allah

from them - for this you made no expedition
with either cavalry or camelry. But Allfill
gives power to His Messengers over
whomsoever He wills. And Allfill is Able to
do all things.
7. What Allah gave as booty (Fai') to His
Messenger (Muhammad rl---'J <p .ii 1~ ) from
the people of the townships - it is for Allah,
His Messenger (Muhammad rl---'J ~ .ii 1 .;..,),
the kindred (of Messenger Muhammad.ii 1 .;..,
r!--J ~). the orphans, Al-Masdkin (the poor),
and the wayfarer, in order that it may not
become a fortune used by the rich among you.
And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad
r1--J .....i,. .ii 1~ ) gives you, take it; and
whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from
it). 111 And fear Allfill; verily, Allah is Severe
in punishment.
8. (And there is also a share in this booty)
for the poor emigrants, who were expelled
from their homes and their property, seeking
Bounties from Allah and to please Him, and
helping Allfill (i.e. helping His religion) and
His Messenger (Muhammad r-1--J ~ .ii 1 .;..,).
Such are indeed the truthful (to what they
say).

111 (V.59:7) Narrated 'Alqamah: 'Abdullah (bin Mas'Qd) said."Allah curses those ladies who
practise tatooing and those who get themselves tatooed, and those ladies who get their hair
removed from their eyebrows and faces except the beard and moustache, and those who
make artificial spaces between their teeth in order to look more beautiful whereby they
change Allah's creation." His saying reached a lady from BanQ Asad, called Umm Ya'qub,
who came (to 'Abdullah) and said, "I have come to know that you have cursed
such-and-such (ladies)?" He replied, "Why should I not curse these whom Allah's
Messenger r1-J ~ -» 1 ..;- has cursed and who are (cursed) in Allah's Book!" Umm Ya'qub
said, "I have read the whole Qur'An, but I did not find in it what you say." He said, "Verily, if
you have read it (i.e. the Qur'An), you have found it. Didn't you read:
"And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad ,.LJ ~ -» 1 cr1-) gives you, take it, and
whatsoever he forbids you, abstain (from it)." (V.59:7).
She replied, "Yes, I did", He said, "Verily, Allah's Messenger r-1--, ~ .iJ 1 ..;- forbade such
things." She said, "But I see your wife doing these things?" He said, "Go and watch her".
She went and watched her but could not see anything in support of her statement. On that
he said, "If my wife was as you thought, I would not keep her in my company" (i.e I would
divorce her). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.408).
Narrated 'Abdullah (bin Mas'ud) ~ -» 1 ~ ; : Allah's Messenger rLJ ~ -» 1 ..;- has cursed
the lady who uses false hair. (See Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.409).

9. And (it is also for) those who, before

them, had homes (in Al-Madinah) and had
adopted the Faith, love those who emigrate to
them, and have no jealousy in their breasts for
that which they have been given (from the
booty of Barn} An-Nadir), and give them
(emigrants) preference over themselves even
though they were in need of that. And
whosoever is saved from his own

"Our Lord! Forgive us and our brethren who
have preceded us in Faith, and put not in our
hearts any hatred against those who have
believed. Our Lord! You are indeed full of
kindness, Most Merciful.
11. Have you (0 Muhammad ~ ..:u I J-o

their friends among the people of the
Scripture who disbelieve: "(By Allah) If you
are expelled, we (too) indeed will go out with
you, and we shall never obey any one against
you; and if you are attacked (in fight), we
shall indeed help you." But Allah is Witness
that they verily are liars.
12. Surely, if they (the Jews) are expelled,
never will they (hypocrites) go out with them;
and if they are attacked, they will never help
them. And (even) if they do help them, they
(hypocrites) will tum their backs, and they
will not be victorious.

13. Verily, you (believers in the Oneness
of Allah - Islamic Monotheism) are more
fearful in their (Jews of Barn} An-Nadir)
breasts than Allah. That is because they are a
people who comprehend not (the Majesty and
Power of Allah).
14. They fight not against you even
together, except in fortified townships, or
from behind walls. Their enmity among
themselves is very great. You would think
they were united, but their hearts are divided.
That is because they are a people who
understand not.

driven you out of your homes, and helped to
drive you out, that Allah forbids you to
befriend them. And whosoever will befriend
them, then such are the Zdlimun (wrong-doers
- those who disobey Allah).
10. 0 you who believe! When believing
women come to you as emigrants, examine
them; Allah knows best as to their Faith, then
if you ascertain that they are true believers
send them not back to the disbelievers. They
are not lawful (wives) for the disbelievers nor
are the disbelievers lawful (husbands) for
them. But give them (the disbelievers) that
(amount of money) which they have spent [as
their Mahr 111 ] to them. And there will be no
sin on you to marry them if you have paid
their Mahr to them. Likewise hold not the
disbelieving women as wives, and ask for (the
return of) that which you have spent (as
Mahr) and let them (the disbelievers) ask
back for that which they have spent. That is
the Judgement of Allah, He judges between

to those whose wives have gone, the
equivalent of what they had spent (on their
Mahr). And fear Allfill in Whom you believe.
12. 0 Prophet! When believing women
come to you to give you the Bai 'ah (pledge),
that they will not associate anything in
worship with Allfill, that they will not steal,
that they will not commit illegal sexual
intercourse, that they will not kill their
children, that they will not utter slander,
intentionally forging falsehood (i.e. by
making illegal children belonging to their
husbands), and that they will not disobey you
in Ma 'ruf (Islmnic Monotheism and all that
which Islmn ordains), then accept their
Bai 'ah (pledge), and ask Allah to forgive
them. Verily, Allfill is Oft-Forgiving, Most
Merciful.
13. 0 you who believe! Take not as
friends the people who incurred the Wrath of
Allah (i.e. the Jews). Surely, they have
despaired of (receiving any good in) the
Hereafter, just as the disbelievers have
despaired of those (buried) in graves (that
they will not be resurrected on the Day of

3. He has created the heavens and the
earth with truth, and He shaped you and made
good your shapes. And to Him is the final
Return.

4. He knows what is in the heavens and on
earth, and He knows what you conceal and
what you reveal. And Allah is the All-Knower
of what is in the breasts (of men).
S. Has not the news reached you of those
who disbelieved aforetime? And so they
tasted the evil result of their disbelief, and
theirs will be a painful torment.
6. That was because there came to them
their Messengers with clear proofs (signs),
but they said: "Shall mere men guide us?" So
they disbelieved and turned away (from the
truth). But Allah was not in need (of them).
And Allah is Rich (Free of all needs), Worthy
of all praise.
7. The disbelievers pretend that they will
never be resurrected (for the Account). Say

you will be informed of (and recompensed

the Hell-fire and gain for the believers as they
will enter Paradise). And whosoever believes
in Allah and performs righteous good deeds,
He will expiate from him his sins, and will
admit him to Gardens under which rivers flow
(Paradise) to dwell therein forever; that will
be the great success.

10. But those who disbelieved (in the
Oneness of Allah - Islfunic Monotheism) and

whereupon, if he wishes to keep her, he can do so, and if he wishes to divorce her he can
divorce her before having sexual intercourse with her; and that is the 'lddah (prescribed
period) which AIIAh has fixed for the women meant to be divorced." (Sahih Al-Bukhari,

their (husband's) homes nor shall they
(themselves) leave, except in case they are
guilty of some open illegal sexual intercourse.
And those are the set limits of Allah. And
whosoever transgresses the set limits of
Allah, then indeed he has wronged himself.
You (the one who divorces his wife) know
not it may be that Allah will afterward bring
some new thing to pass (i.e. to return her back
to you if that was the first or second divorce).
2. Then when they are about to attain their
tenn appointed, either take them back in a
good manner or part with them in a good
manner. And take as witness two just persons
from among you (Muslims). And establish the
testimony for Allah. That will be an
admonition given to him who believes in
Allah and the Last Day. And whosoever fears
Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He will
make a way for him to get out (from every
difficulty).
3. And He will provide him from
(sources) he never could imagine. And
whosoever puts his trust in Allah, then He
will suffice him.
Verily, Allah will
accomplish his purpose. Indeed Allah has set
a measure for all things.
4. And those of your women as have
passed the age of monthly courses, for them
the 'Jddah (prescribed period), if you have
doubt (about their periods), is three months;
and for those who have no courses [(i.e. they
are still immature) their 'lddah (prescribed

5. That is the Command of Allah, which
He has sent down to you; and whosoever
fears Allah and keeps his duty to Him, He
will expiate from him his sins, and will
enlarge his reward.

6. Lodge them (the divorced women)
where you dwell, according to your means,
and do not harm them so as to straiten them
(that they be obliged to leave your house).
And if they are pregnant, then spend on them
till they lay down their burden. Then if they
give suck to the children for you, give them
their due payment, and let each of you accept
the advice of the other in a just way. But if
you make difficulties for one another, then
some other woman may give suck for him
(the father of the child).
7. Let the rich man spend according to his
means; and the man whose resources are
restricted, let him spend according to what
Allah has given him. Allah puts no burden on
any person beyond what He has given him.
Allah will grant after hardship, ease.
8. And many a town (population) revolted
against the Command of its Lord and His
Messengers; and We called it to a severe
account (i.e. torment in this worldly life), and
We shall punish it with a horrible torment (in
Hell in the Hereafter).

and an eternal punishment in the Hereafter).

a) Narrated Abu-Sa'id ...:.. ..li 1 ~J: I heard the Prophet rL, ',!.l& ..li I J-o saying, "Allah will lay
bare His Shin and then all the believers, men and women, will prostrate themselves before
Him; but there will remain those who used to prostrate themselves in the world for showing
off and for gaining good reputation. Such a one will try to prostrate himself (on the Day of
Judgement) but his back (bones) will become a single (vertebra) bone (so he will not be
able to prostrate). (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol.6, Hadith No.441 ).
b) See the footnote of (V.3:73) ..:U I ..::..lA....
c) Narrated Abu Sa'id AI-Khudri w ..li 1 ~J: We said, "O Allah's Messenger! Shall we see
our Lord on the Day of Resurrection?" He said, "Do you have any difficulty in seeing the sun
and the moon when the sky is clear?" We said, "No." He said, "So you will have no difficulty
in seeing your Lord on that Day as you have no difficulty in seeing the sun and the moon (in
a clear sky)." The Prophet ,1-J ~ ..li I J-o then said, "Somebody will then announce, 'Let
every nation follow what they used to worship.' So the people of the Cross will go with their
Cross, and the idolaters (will go) with their idols, and the worshippers of every god (false
deities) (will go) with their god: till there remain those who used to worship Allah, from the
righteous pious ones and the mischievous ones, and some of the people of the Scripture
(Jews and Christians). Then Hell will be presented to them as if it were a mirage. Then it

water.' Then it will be said to them 'Drink', and they will fall down in Hell (instead). Then it
will be said to the Christians, 'What did you use to worship?' They will reply, 'We used to
worship Messiah, the son of Allah.' It will be said, 'You are liars, for Allah has neither a wife
nor a son. What do you want (now)?' They will say, 'We want You to provide us with water.'
It will be said to them, 'Drink,' and they will fall down in Hell (instead): till there remain only
those who used to worship Allah (Alone), from the righteous pious ones and the
mischievous evil ones, it will be said to them, 'What keeps you here when all the people
have gone?' They will say, 'We left them (in the world) when we were in greater need of
them than we are today; we heard the call of one proclaiming - Let every nation follow
what they used to worship, - and now we are waiting for our Lord.' Then the Almighty will
come to them in a shape other than the one which they saw the first time, and He will say, 'I
am your Lord,' and they will say, 'You are our Lord.' And none will speak to Him then but
the Prophets. And then it will be said to them, 'Do you know any sign by which you can
recognise Him?' They will say, 'The Shin,' and so Allah will then uncover His Shin
whereupon every believer will prostrate himself before Him and there will remain those who
used to prostrate themselves before Him just for showing off and for gaining good
reputation. Such a one will try to prostrate himself but his back (bones) will become a single
(vertebra) bone [like one piece of a wood and he will not be able to prostrate]. Then the
bridge will be brought and laid across Hell." We (the Companions of the Prophet <,iu: ..:u, ~
f-J) said, "O Allah's Messenger! What is the bridge?" He said, "It is a slippery (bridge) on
which there are clamps and (hooks like) a thorny seed that is wide at one side and narrow
at the other and has thorns with bent ends. Such a thorny seed is found in Najd and is
called As-Sa'dan. Some of the believers will cross the bridge as quickly as the wink of an
eye, some others as quick as lightning, or a strong wind, or fast horses or she-camels. So
some will be safe without any harm; some will be safe after receiving some scratches and
some will fall down into Hell (Fire). The last person will cross as if being dragged (over the
bridge)." The Prophet r!-J ._,i.., ..:U, ..,-k said, "You (Muslims) cannot be more pressing in
claiming from me a right that has been clearly proved to be yours than the believers in
interceding with Almighty for their (Muslim) brothers on that Day, when they see themselves
safe. They will say, 'O Allah! (Save) our brothers (for they) used to pray with us, fast with us
and also do good deeds with us.' Allah will say, 'Go and take out (of Hell) anyone in whose
heart you find Faith equal to the weight of one (gold) Dinar.' Allah will forbid the Fire to burn
the faces of those sinners. They will go to them and find some of them in Hell (Fire) up to
their feet, and some up to the middle of their legs. So, they will take out those whom they
will recognise and then they will return. And Allah will say (to them), 'Go and take out (of
Hell) anyone in whose heart you find Faith equal to the weight of one-half Dinar.' They will
take out whomever they will recognise and return. And then Allah will say, 'Go and take out
(of Hell) anyone in whose heart you find Faith equal to the weight of an atom (or a small
ant), and so they will take out all those whom they will recognise." Abu Sa'id said: "If you do
not believe me then read the Holy Verse: 'Surely Allah wrongs not even of the weight of an
atom (or a small ant) but if there is any good (done), He doubles it.' (V.4:40)."
The Prophet ,L,J ._,i.., ..:U 1 ..,-k added: "Then the Prophets and angels and the believers will
intercede, and (last of all) the Almighty (Allah) will say, 'Now remains My Intercession. He
will then hold a handful of the Fire from which He will take out some people whose bodies
have been burnt, and they will be thrown into a river at the entrance of Paradise, called the
Water of Life. They will grow on its banks, as a seed carried by the torrent grows. You have
noticed how it grows beside a rock or beside a tree, and how the side facing the sun is
usually green while the side facing the shade is white. Those people will come out (of the
River of Life) like pearls, and they will have (golden) necklaces, and then they will enter
Paradise whereupon the people of Paradise will say, 'These are the people emancipated by
the Gracious. He has admitted them into Paradise without (them) having done any good
deed and without sending forth any good (for themselves).' Then it will be said to them, 'For
you is what you have seen and its equivalent as well.' " (Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. 9, Hadith

mistaken and just wastes his efforts, and troubles himself with what is beyond his limited

111 (V.85:4) The Story of the Boy and the King.
Narrated Shu'aib ~ .ii 1 ~ ; : AIIAh's Messenger ,.i-,J ~ .ii 1 .)..o said: "Among the people
before you, there was a king and he had a sorcerer. When the sorcerer became old, he
said to the king: 'I have now become an old man, get me a boy so that I may teach him
sorcery.' So the king sent him a boy to teach him sorcery. Whenever the boy proceeded to
the sorcerer, he sat with a monk who was on the way and listened to his talks and used to
admire them (those talks). So when he went to the sorcerer, he passed by the monk and
sat there with him. And on visiting the sorcerer, the latter thrashed him. So the boy
complained about that to the monk. The monk said to him: Whenever you are afraid of the
sorcerer, say to him: 'My people kept me busy'; and whenever you are afraid of your
people, say to them: 'The sorcerer kept me busy.' So the boy carried on like that (for a
period).
"There came (on the main road) a huge creature (animal), and the people were unable to
pass by. The boy said: 'Today I will know whether the sorcerer is better or the monk'. So he
took a stone and said: 'O AIIAh! If the deeds and actions of the monk are liked by You
better than those of the sorcerer, then kill this creature so that the people can cross (the
road).' Then he hit (it) with the stone, and it was killed and the people passed (the road).
The boy came to the monk and informed him about it. The monk said to him: 'O my son!
Today you are better than I; you have achieved what I see! And you will be put to trial. And
in case you are put to trial, do not inform (them) about me.' The boy used to treat the
people suffering from born-blindness, leprosy, leucoderma, and other diseases. A blind
courtier of the king heard about the boy. He came and brought a number of gifts for the boy
and said: 'All these gifts are for you on condition that you cure me'.The boy said: 'I do not
cure anybody; it is only AIIAh (Alone) Who cures (people). So if you believe in AIIAh, and
invoke AIIAh, He will cure you'. He then believed in AIIAh, and AIIAh cured him. Later the
courtier came to the king, and sat at the place where he used to sit before. The king asked
him: 'Who has given you your sight back?' The courtier replied:'My Lord (AIIAh)!' The king
said: 'Have you got another lord than I?' The courtier said: 'My Lord and your Lord is AIIAh!'
The king got hold of him and kept on tormenting him till he informed him about the boy. So
the boy was brought. The king said to the boy: 'O boy! Has your (knowledge of) sorcery
reached to the extent that you cure born-blinds, lepers, leucodermic patients and do such
and such?' The boy replied: 'I do not cure anybody; it is only AIIAh (Alone) Who does cure'.
Then the king got hold of him, and kept on tormenting him till he informed him about the
monk. And the monk was brought, and it was said to him: 'Give up your religion (turn
apostate)!' The monk refused to turn apostate. Then the king ordered (to be bring) a saw,
and it was put in the middle of his scalp and was sawn, till he fell. cut in two pieces. Then
that courtier was brought, and it was said to him: 'Give up your religion (turn apostate)!' The
courtier refused to turn apostate. So the saw was put in the middle of his scalp, and was
sawn till he fell, cut in two pieces. Then the boy was brought, and it was said to him: 'Give
up your religion (turn apostate)!' The boy refused to turn apostate. So the king ordered
some of his courtiers to take the boy to such and such a mountain saying, 'Then ascend up
the mountain with him till you reach its top, and see if he turns apostate (from his religion,
well and good); otherwise throw him down from its top.' They took him, ascended up the

mountain shook and all of them fell down, and the boy came walking to the king. The king
asked him: 'What did your companions do?' The boy said: 'Allah has saved me from them.'
The king then ordered some of his courtiers to take the boy on board a boat into the middle
of the sea, saying, 'Then if he turns apostate (from his religion, well and good), otherwise
cast him into the sea.' So they took him, and he said: 'O Allah! Save me from them by
anything You wish.' So the boat capsized, and (all the accompanying courtiers) were
drowned. The boy then came walking to the king. The king said: 'What did your
companions do?' The boy replied: 'Allah saved me from them', and he further said to the
king: 'You cannot kill me till you do what I command!' The king said: 'What is that
(command of yours)?' The boy said: 'Gather all the people in an upland place, and fasten
me to the stem (of a tree); then take an arrow from my quiver and fix it in the bow, and say:
- In the Name of Allah, the Lord of the boy, - and shoot (me). If you do that, you will kill
me.' So the king gathered the people in an upland place, and fastened the boy to the stem,
took an arrow from his quiver, fixed it in the bow, and said: 'In the Name of Allah, the Lord
of the boy', and shot the arrow. The arrow hit the temporal region of the skull of the boy,
and the boy put his hand over the temporal region of his skull at the point where the arrow
hit, and then died. The people proclaimed: 'We have believed in the Lord of the boy! We
have believed in the Lord of the boy! We have believed in the Lord of the boy!' The king
came, and it was said to him: 'That is the thing which you were afraid of. By Allah! The
thing which you were afraid of, has fallen upon you, the people have believed (in Allah).' So
he ordered (deep) ditches to be dug at the entrances of the roads, and it was done, then
fire was kindled in those ditches, and the king ordered that whoever did not tum apostate
(from his religion) be cast into the ditches, and it was done. Then there came a woman with
her babe. She nearly retreated back from the ditch but the babe said (spoke): 'O mother!
Be patient, you are on the Truth,' (So she threw herself in the ditch of the fire alongwith her
child to be with the martyrs in the Paradise)." (Sahih Muslim, Vol. 4, Hadith No. 7148).

131 (V.89:3) "Even" and "Odd" is interpreted differently by different religious scholars. Some
say: Even is the Day of Slaughtering of the Sacrifices, i.e. 10th of Dhul-Hiliah, and Odd is

Odd is Allah. Some say it is the compulsory congregational prayer, i.e. Maghrib is Witr, and

111 (V.105:5) The story of the army of the Elephants (the Qur'An 105:1-5). This incident
happened during the period of the birth-year of Prophet Muhammad r1-J ~ ..ii 1 ..,-i- .
Abrahah Al-Ashram was the governor of Yemen on behalf of the king of Ethiopia (as
Yemen was a part of the Ethiopian kingdom). He (Abrahah) thought to build a house (like
the Ka'bah at Makkah) in San'a (the capital of Yemen) and call the Arabs to perform the
pilgrimage there in San'a instead of the Ka'bah (Al-Bait A/-Haram) in Makkah, with the
intention of diverting the trade and benefits from Makkah to Yemen. He presented his idea
to the king of Ethiopia who agreed to his idea. So the house (church) was built and he
named it Al-Qullais; there was no church of its like at that time. Then a man from the
Quraish tribe of Makkah came there and was infuriated by it, so he relieved his nature
(stools and urine) in it, soiled its walls and went away. When Abrahah Al-Ashram saw that,
he could not control his anger and raised an army to invade Makkah and demolish the
Ka'bah. He had in that army thirteen elephants and amongst them was an elephant called
Mahmud which was the biggest of them. So that army proceeded and none amongst the
Arab tribes that faced them (fought against them) but was killed and defeated, till it
approached near Makkah. Then there took place negotiations between Abrahah Al-Ashram
and the chief of Makkah (Abdul Muttalib bin HAshim, the grandfather of the Prophet .ii, .,i..,
r1-J ~). and it was concluded that Abrahah would restore the camels of Abdul Muttalib
which he had taken away, and then he (Abrahah Al-Ashram) would decide himself as
regards the Ka'bah. Abdul Muttalib ordered the men of Makkah to evacuate the city and go
to the top of the mountains along with their wives and children in case some harm should
,'?,•. come to them from the invading oppressors. Then that army moved towards Makkah till

of the valley, suddenly it was overtaken by flocks of birds, flocks after flocks, air-raiding that
army with small stones slightly bigger than a lentil seed. There never fell a stone on a
soldier except it dissolved his flesh and burst it into pieces. So they perished with a total
destruction. Abrahah Al-Ashram fled away while his flesh was bursting into pieces till he
died on the way (back to Yemen). Such was the victory bestowed by Allah, (the

Ruh-ullah

(...:U I rJ.J According to the early religious scholars from
among the Companions of the Prophet ~J .,,i.'" 1 ~ and their
students and the Mujtahidun, there is a rule to distinguish
between the two nouns in the genitive construction:

(A) When one of the two nouns is Allah, and the other is a
person or a thing, e.g., (i) Allah's House (Bait-ullah ~
...:U I ), (ii)
Allah's Messenger; (iii) Allah's slave
( 'Abdullah ...:U I~ ); (iv) Allah's spirit (Ruh-ulldh ...:U I rJ,; )
etc.
The rule of the above words is that the second noun, e.g.,
House, Messenger, slave, spirit, etc. is created by Allah and
is honourable with Him and similarly Allah's spirit may be
understood as the spirit of Allah, in fact, it is a soul created
by Allah, i.e. 'Isa (Jesus), and it was His Word: "Be!" and he was created (like the creation of Adam).
(B) But when one of the two is Allah and the second is
neither a person nor a thing, then it is not a created thing
but is a quality of Allah, e.g., (i) Allah's Knowledge
( '1/mulldh ...:U I~); (ii) Allah's Life (Hayatulldh ...:U I o\+> );
(iii) Allah's Statement (Ka/dmulldh ...:U I ~)LS'); (iv) Allah's

or ignoring them completely or twisting the meanings or

day of'Arafah (Hajj, i.e. 9th Dhul-Hijjah) as mentioned by

Knowledge, not by His Personal Self (Bi-Dhtitihi), "There
is nothing like unto Him, and He is the All-Hearer, the AllSeer." (The Qur'an, V. 42: 11 ).
This Noble Verse proves the quality of hearing and the
quality of sight for Allah without likening it (or giving
resemblance) to others; and likewise He also says:
"To one whom I have created with Both My Hands," (V.
38:75); and He also says:
"The Hand of Allah is over their hands.": (V. 48: 10, the
Qur'an). This confirms two Hands for Allah, but there is no
similarity for them.

WHY ALLAH SENT PROPHETS AND MESSENGERS r'.)l..JI ~ ?
Ever since people innovated the dogma of Shirk, (i.e. joining others in worship
along with Allah) Allah had been sending Prophets and Messengers to his devotees
in order to invite them to the worship of Allah and Allah Alone, to order them not
to ascribe partners unto Him and bring them out of the darkness of polytheism into
the light of Monotheism. All the Prophets preached Tauhid (i.e. Monotheism, the
Belief in the Oneness of Allah, the Glorious, the Elevated. The following verses
from the Noble Quran illustrate this fact :
"Indeed We sent Nfih (Noah) to his people, and he said : 'O my people !
Worship Allah ! You have no other 1/dh (God) but Him.(La illaha il/allah, none
has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Certainly, I fear for you the torment of a
great Day!" (V. 7:59).
"And to 'Ad (people, We sent) their brother Hfid. He said: 'O my people!
Worship Allah ! You have no other I/ah (God) but Him. (Ld ii/aha il/al/ah, none
has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Will you not fear (Allah)?" (V.7:65).
And to (the people of) Madyan, (We sent) their brother Shu'aib. He said: 0
my people ! Worship Allah you have no other 1/dh (God) but Him. (Ld ii/aha
illallah, none has the right to be worshipped but Allah). Verily, a clear proof(sign)
from your Lord has come unto you, so give full measure and full weight and wrong
not men in their things, and do not make mischief on the earth after it has been set
in order, that will be better for you, if you are believers." (V.7:85)
"And to Thamfid (people, We sent) their brother Salih. He said: 'O my people!
Worship Allah ! You have no other Ildh (God) but Him. (la ii/aha ii/al/ah, none
has the right to be worshipped but Allah)."' (V.7:73)
"And verily, We have sent among every Ummah (community, nation) a
Messenfier (proclaiming) : Worship Allah (Alone) and avoid (or keep away from)
Tdghut 11 (all false deities i.e. do not worship Taghut besides Allah)." (V. 16:36)
Every Prophet was sent unto his own nation for their guidance, but the message of
Prophet Muhammad r-1:--J ~ .» 1 ~ was general for all mankind and jinn. As in
Surat al A' raf(Allah addresses His Messenger r!-J ~ .» 1 ._;...):
"Say (0 Muhammad ~J ~ .ii 1 ._;...):
as the messenger of Allah.' " (V. 7: 158).

·o mankind: Verily, I am sent to you all

So the aim of sending these Prophets and Mesengers to men and jinn was only
that they should worship Allah Alone as Allah JW said :
"And I (Allah) created not the jinn and men except they should worship Me
(Alone)" (V.51:56).
And to worship Allah means to obey Him and to do all He has ordained,-and
to fear Him by abstaining from all He has forbidden.
Then those who will obey Allah will be rewarded in Paradise, those who will
disobey Him will be punished in Hell-fire

Tauhid (Islamic Monothesim)

"

TAUHID- (ISLAMIC MONOTHEISM)
Tauhid (Islamic Monotheism) has three aspects:
(A) Oneness of the Lordship of Allah; Tauhid-ar-Rububiyyah: To believe
that there is only one Lord for all the universe, Who is its Creator, Organizer,
Planner, Sustainer, and the Giver of security, etc., and that is Allah.
(B) Oneness of the Worship of Allah; Tauhid-al-Uluhiyyah: To believe that
none has the right to be worshipped (e.g. praying, invoking, asking for help from
the unseen, swearing, offering sacrifice, giving charity, fasting, pilgrimage) but
Allah.
(C) Oneness of the Names and the Qualities of Allah: Tauhid-al-Asma' wasSifat: To believe that:
(i) We must not name or qualify Allah except with what He or His
~ ..:iJ I ~ has named or qualified Him;
Messenger
(ii) None can be named or qualified with the Names or Qualifications of
Allah; e.g. Al-Karim;
(iii) We must believe in all the qualities of Allah which Allah has stated
in His Book (the Qur'an) or mentioned through His Messenger
(Muhammad r-1--'-' ~ ..:iJ 1 ~ ) without changing their meaning or
ignoring them completely or twisting the meanings or likening them
(giving resemblance) to any of the created things e.g. Allah is
present over His Throne as mentioned in the Qur'an (V. 20:5):"The Most Gracious (Allah) rose over (/stawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in a
manner that suits His Majesty)," over the seventh heaven; and He comes
down over the first (nearest) heaven to us on the day of' Arafah (Hajj, i.e.
the 9th of Dhul-Hijja), and also during the last third part of the night as
mentioned by the Prophet r-1--'J ~ ..:iJ 1 ~ , but He is with us by His
Knowledge, not by His Personal-Self (bi-Dhatihi).
(It is not as some people think that Allah is present everywhere - here,
there and even inside the breasts of men).
Also Allah says:
"There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer"
(V.42:11).
This holy Verse proves the quality of hearing and the quality of sight for
Allah without likening them (or giving resemblance) to any of the created
things) and likewise He Jo?-., :r also says:
"To one whom I have created with Both My Hands," (V.38:75);
and He also says:
"The Hand of Allah is over their hands." (V .48: 10).
This confirms two Hands for Allah, but there is no similarity for them.
This is the belief of all true believers, and was the belief of all the
Prophets of Allah, from Nfih (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham), Musa (Moses)
and 'Isa (Jesus) till the last of the Prophets, Muhammad
~ ..:iJ I ~ These three aspects of Tauhid are included in the meaning of La ilaha ii/al/ah
(none has the right to be worshipped but Allah).
It is also essential to follow Allah's Messenger, Muhammad

Wujub al-lttiba' and it is a part of Tauhid-al-Uluhiyyah.

SHAHADA -

Shahada

CONFESSION OF A MUSLIM
.ii I J,-.,.J ~ 4....1.11 ~[ ~[~

La ilaha illallah, Muhammad-ur- Rasul-Allah
(None has the right to be worshipped but Allah,
and Muhammad r-1-J ~ ..li, cs1..o is the Messenger of Allah).
It has been noticed that most mankind, who embrace Islam, do not understand
the reality of the meaning of the first fundamental principle of Islam, i.e. La
i/aha illallah, Muhammad-ur-Rasul-Allah (none has the right to be worshipped
but Allah, and Muhammad ri--J ~ ..li, ..L is the Messenger of Allah). So I
consider it essential to explain something of the meanings of this great sentence
(principle) in some detail:
Ail I JJ-'.J ..i.......>-o 4....1.JI ~! ~!~
La ilaha il/allah, Muhammad-ur- Rasul-Allah
"None has the right to be worshipped but Allah ... and Muhammad cs1..o
r-1-J ~ ..li I is the Messenger of Allah" has three aspects: a,b and c.
a. It is that, you have to pledge a covenant with (Allah), the Creator of the
heavens and earth, the Ruler of all that exists, the Lord of Majesty and
Highness, on four points (or conditions):
Point I: A confession with your heart that the Creator ( of everything) is
Allah; it is that you have to say: "I testify that the Creator of all the universe
including the stars, the planets, the sun, the moon, the heavens, the earth with all
its known and unknown forms of life, is Allah. He is the Organizer and Planner
of all its affairs. It is He Who gives life and death, and He (i.e. Allah Alone) is
the Sustainer, and the Giver of security." And this is called (your confession for
the) "Oneness of the Lordship of Allah," - Tauhid-ar-Rububiyyah.
Point II: A confession with your heart that: "I testify that none has the right
to be worshipped but Allah Alone." The word "worship" (i.e. 'lbddah) carries a
great number of meanings in the Islamic terminology: it conveys that all kinds
of worship are meant for Allah Alone (and none else, whether it be an angel,
Messenger, Prophet 'Isa (Jesus) - son of Maryam (Mary), 'Uzair (Ezra),
Muhammad, saint, idol, the sun, the moon and all other kinds of false deities.)
So pray to none but Allah, invoke none but Allah, ask for help from none
(unseen) but Allah, swear by none but Allah, offer an animal as sacrifice to
none but Allah, ... etc, and that means, - all that Allah and His Messenger
Muhammad ri--'J ~ ..li, ..L order you to do, (in the Qur'an and in the Sunna
(legal ways of Prophet Muhammad r-1-J ~ ..li I cs1..o ) you must do, and all that
Allah and His Messenger Muhammad r-1-J ~ ..li, cs1..o forbid you, you must not
do. And this is called (your confession for the) "Oneness of the worship of
Allah," - Tauhid-al-Uluhiyyah. And that you (mankind) worship none but
Allah.
Point Ill: A confession with your heart that: "O Allah! I testify that all the
best of names and the most perfect qualities with which You have named or
qualified Yourself in Your Book (i.e. the Qur'an) or as Your Prophet
Muhammad ri--J ~ ..li 1 ..L has named or qualified You, with his statement, I
believe that all those (names and qualities) are for You without changing their
meanings or neglecting them completely or likening them (giving resemblance)
to others." As Allah says:
www.holybooks.com

Appendix II

895

Shahada

"There is nothing like unto Him and He is the All-Hearer, the All-Seer."
(V. 42:11).
This holy Verse confirms the quality of hearing and the quality of sight for
Allah without likening them (giving resemblance) to others, and He also says:
"To one whom I have created with Both My Hands," (V.38:75)
and He also says:
"The Hand of Allah is over their hands." (V.48:10)
This confirms two Hands for Allah, but there is no similarity for them. Similarly
Allah says:
"The Most Gracious (Allah) rose over (Jstawa) the (Mighty) Throne (in
a manner that suits His Majesty)." (V.20:5).
So He rose over the Throne really in a manner that suits His Majesty. And
Allah is over His Throne over the seventh heaven, as the slave-girl pointed
towards the heavens, when Allah's Messenger (Muhammad r'-' ~ .ii 1..;- )
asked her as to where Allah is. He comes down over the first (nearest) heaven to
us during the last third part of every night and also on the day of' Arafah (Hajj,
i.e. the 9th of Dhul-Hijja), as mentioned by the Prophet r'-' ~ .ii 1 ..;- , but He
is with us by His Knowledge, not by His Personal-Self (bi-Dhatihi). It is not, as
some people say that Allah is present everywhere - here, there, and even
inside the breasts of men. He sees and hears all that we do or utter. And this is
called (your confession for the) "Oneness of the Names and Qualities of Allah"
- Tauhid-al-Asmd' was-Sifdt and this is the right belief, the belief which was
followed by the Messengers of Allah [from Nfih (Noah), Ibrahim (Abraham),
Musa (Moses), Dawfid (David), Sulaiman (Solomon), 'Isa (Jesus) to
Muhammad r')l..J1_, ,")l...,JI ~ and the Companions of Prophet Muhammad .ii 1 ..;r'-' ~] and the righteous followers of these Messengers r')l..JI ~ .
Point IV: A confession with your heart: "O Allah! I testify that Muhammad
r-1--., ~ .ii 1 _,i.., is Your Messenger." That means that none has the right to be
followed after Allah, but the Prophet Muhammad r'-' ~ .ii 1 ..;- as he is the last
of His Messengers. As Allah says:
"Muhammad (r-1--., ~ .ii 1 _,i..,) is not the father of any man among you,
but he is the Messenger of Allah and the last (end) of the Prophets. And
Allah is Ever All-Aware of everything." (V.33:40).
"And whatsoever the Messenger (Muhammad r'-' ~ .ii 1 ..;- ) gives you,
take it and whatsoever he forbids you, abstain from it,"(V.59:7).
And Allah says:
"Say (0 Muhammad r-1--., ~ .ii 1 ...-i,.., to mankind): 'If you (really) love
Allah, then follow me (i.e. accept Islamic Monothesim, follow The
Qur'an and The Sunnah).' "(V.3:31)
As for others than Muhammad r-1--J ~ .ii 1 ...-i,..,, their statements are to be
taken or rejected as to whether these are in accordance with Allah's Book (i.e.
the Qur'an) and with the Sunnah (legal ways, orders, acts of worship,
statements) of the Prophet rl--J ~ .ii 1 ..;- or not. As the Divine revelation has
stopped after the death of Prophet Muhammad r-'-' ~ .ii 1 ..;- and it will not
resume except at the time of the Descent of 'Isa (Jesus) - son of Maryam
(Mary) and he (i.e. Jesus) will rule with justice according to the Islamic laws,
during the last days of the world as it has been mentioned in the authentic

Shahada

Hadith (i.e. narration of Prophet Muhammad ,.i-,, ~ .:ii 1 ~ ) . (Sahih-AIBukhari, Vol. 3, Hadith No. 425).
B. It is essential to utter: Ld i/dha i//al/dh, Muhammad-ur-Rasiil Alldh (none
has the right to be worshipped but Allah, and Muhammad ,J-,, ~ ..ii 1 ~ is the
Messenger of Allah.) As it has come in the statement of the Prophet Muhammad
t:""-' ~ .:ii 1 ~ to his uncle Abu Talib at the time of the latter's death: "O uncle,
1f you utter it (Ld ilah illa/ldh, Muhammad-ur-Rasii/ Allah. none has the right to
be worshipped but Allah, and Muhammad ,J-,., ~ .:ii 1 ~ is the Messenger of
Allah), then I shall be able to argue on your behalf before Allah, on the Day of
Resurrection." Similarly, when Abu Dharr Al-ghifari embraced Islam, he went
to A/-Masjid-a/-Hardm and he proclaimed it loudly in front of the Quraish
infidels until he was beaten severely.
C. It is essential that the limbs and all the other parts and organs of one's
body testify to it, and this is very important as regards its meaning (i.e., the
meaning of Ld i/dha i/lal/dh Muhammad Rasul Alldh - none has the right to
be worshipped but Allah, and Muhammad ,.i.,., ~ ..ii 1 ~ is the Messenger of
Allah). So whoever has confessed this (to his Lord), he shall not commit sins
like robbing, killing, stealing, illegal sexual intercourse, eating pig meat,
drinking alcoholic beverages, taking undue advantage of orphan's property,
cheating in trade, bribery and earning money through illegal means, telling lies,
backbiting or otherwise the limbs and all the other parts and organs of his body
will testify against him that he was a liar in his words which he pledged to
Allah. In case he commits the above sins, he should know that it is a sin that
obliges him to repent to Allah, and ask His Forgiveness, as (his) body parts (i.e.
skin, private parts, hands, tongue, ears)will testify to the above mentioned
crimes (i.e. actions) against himself on the Day of Resurrection.
And with the confession of this great sentence (i.e. principle) a person enters
in the fold of the Islamic religion accordingly, it is essential for him to believe
in all the Messengers of Allah and not to differentiate between them. As it is
mentioned in His Book. Allah says:
"Do then those who disbelieve think that they can take My slaves [i.e.
the angels; Allah's Messengers; 'Isa (Jesus), son of Maryam (Mary)] as
Auliyd' (lords, gods, protectors) besides Me? Verily, We have prepared
Hell as an entertainment for the disbelievers (in the Oneness of Allah Islamic Monotheism).
"Say (0 Muhammad ,.i-,., ~ .:ii 1 ~ ): 'Shall We tell you the greatest
losers in respect of (their) deeds?' "Those whose efforts have been
wasted in this life, while they thought they were acquiring good by their
deeds! "They are those who deny the Aydt (proofs, evidences, verses,
lessons, signs, revelations, etc.) of their Lord and the Meeting with Him
(in the Hereafter). So their works are in vain, and on the Day of
Resurrection, We shall not give them any weight. "That shall be their
recompense, Hell; because they disbelieved and took My Aydt (proofs,
evidences, verses, lessons, revelations, etc.) and My Messengers by way
of jest and mockery. "Verily! Those who believe (in the Oneness of
Allah - Islamic Monotheism), and do righteous deeds, shall have the
Gardens of A/-Firdaus (Paradise) for their entertainment. Wherein they

shall dwell (forever). No desire will they have to be removed therefrom.
"Say (0 Muhammad iJ-,J ~ .:ii 1 ..;- to mankind): If the sea were ink for
(writing) the Words of my Lord, surely the sea would be exhausted,
before the Words of my Lord would be finished even ifwe brought
(another sea) like it for its aid"Say (0 Muhammad iJ-,J ~ .:ii 1 ..;- ): I am
only a man like you, it has been revealed to me that your I/ah (God) is
One llah (God, - i.e. Allah). So whoever hopes for the Meeting with
his Lord, let him work righteousness and associate none as a partner in
the worship of his Lord." (V. 18:102-110).
This introduction is necessary for anyone who wishes to embrace Islam.
After this confession he ( or she) should take a bath (i.e. Ghusl) and then offer a
two Rak 'at prayer, and act upon the five principles of Islam, as narrated by lbn
'Umar ~ .:ii 1 ._,;,) in the Book, Sahih Al-Bukhari, Vol. I Hadith No.7:Narrated lbn 'Umar <L..,& .» 1 ._,..;,) : Allah's Messenger iJ-,J ~ .:ii 1 ..;- said:
Islam is based on the following five (principles):
I. To testify la ilaha illal/ah wa anna Muhammad-ur-Rasul-Allah (none has
the right to be worshipped but Allah and that Muhammad is The Messenger
of Allah).
2. To perform (Jqamat) As-Sa/at 111.
3. To pay Zakdt 121 •
4. To perform Hajj (i.e. pilgrimage to Makkah).
5. To observe Saum (fast) during the month of Ramadan.
and must believe in the six articles of Faith, i.e. to believe in:
(l) Allah, (2) His angels, (3) His Messengers, (4) His revealed Books, (5) the
Day of Resurrection,and (6) Al-Qadar (Divine Preordainments i.e. whatever
Allah has ordained must come to pass)
IMPORTANT NOTE:-

The acceptance of the righteous deeds depends on the following two basic
conditions which must be fulfilled:
(1) The intentions while doing such deeds must be totally for Allah's sake
only without any show off or gaining praise or fame, etc.
(2) Such a deed must be performed in accordance with the Sunnah (legal
ways, orders, acts of worship. statements) of Allah's Messenger Muhammad bin
'Abdullah, the last (end) of all the Prophets and the Messengers r')l..J' ~ .

Shirk and Kufr

Ash- Shirk and Al-Kufr
POLYTHEISM AND DISBELIEF
Salvation of all mankind from the greatest sin against AIUah

It is essential to mention here some details of the greatest sin which
will not be forgiven by Allah. This unpardonable sin is Shirk
Shirk implies ascribing partners to Allah or ascribing divine attributes to
others besides Allah and believing that the source of power, harm and blessings
comes from others besides Allah.

Almighty Allah says:
"Verily, Allah forgives not that partners should be ascribed to Him in
worship, but He forgives except that (anything else) to whom He
pleases; and whoever ascribes partners to Allah in worship, has indeed
invented a tremendous sin."(V. 4:48).
Almighty Allah says:
"Then when the Trumpet is blown, there will be no kinship among them
on that Day, nor will they ask of one another.
"Then those whose scales (of good deeds) are heavy, - these! they are
the successful.
"And those whose scales (of good deeds) are light, - they are those
who lose their ownselves; in Hell will they abide."
"The Fire will bum their faces, and they will grin with displaced lips
(disfigured)."
"(It will be said) 'Were not My Verses (this Qur'an) recited to you and
then you used to deny them?'

"They will say: 'Our Lord! Our wretchedness overcame us and we were
an erring people.
"Our Lord! Bring us out of this; if ever we return (to evil) then indeed
we shall be Zdlimun (polytheists, oppressors, unjust, and wrongdoers).'
"He (Allah) will say: 'Remain you in it with ignominy! And speak you
not to Me!' (V. 23: 101-108).
"And whoever invokes (or worships) besides Allah, any other i/dh (god),
of whom he has no proof, then his reckoning is only with his Lord.
Surely! Al-Kafirun (disbelievers in Allah and in the Oneness of Allah,
polytheists, pagans, idolaters) will not be successful." (V. 23: 117).

Ash-Shirk

Ash-Shirk

POLYTHEISM AND ITS VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS
Definition: Shirk basically is polytheism, i.e., the worship of others along with
Allah. It also implies attributing divine attributes to any other besides Allah. It
particularly implies associating partners in worship with Allah or believing that
the source of power, harm or blessings is from others besides Allah.
Types: There are three types of Shirk, namely:
(1)

Ash-Shirk-al-Akbar, i.e. major Shirk

(2)

Ash-Shirk-a/-Asghar, i.e. minor Shirk

(3)

Ash-Shirk-al-Khafi, i.e. inconspicuous Shirk.

Manifestations: (1) Ash-Shirk-al-Akbar (The major Shirk): The major and
serious polytheistic form, has four aspects:
(a)

Shirk-ad-Du 'd, i.e. invocation.This aspect implies invoking, supplicating
or praying to other deities besides Allah.

Almighty Allah says:
"And when they embark on a ships they invoke Allah, making their Faith
pure for Him only, but when He brings them safely to land, behold, they
give a share of their worship to others," (V.29:65)
(b)

Shirk-al-Niyyah wal-Jradah wal-Qasd. This aspect implies intentions,
purpose and determination in acts of worship or religious deeds not for the
sake of Allah but directed towards other deities.

Almighty Allah says:
"Whosoever desires the life of the world and its glitter, to them We shall
pay in full (the wages of) their deeds therein, and they will have no
diminution therein. They are those for whom there is nothing in the
Hereafter but Fire; and vain are the deeds they did therein. And of no
effect is that which they used to do. "(V. 11: 15, 16)
(c)

Shirk-at-Ta 'ah. This aspect implies rendering obedience to any authority
against the Order of Allah.

Almighty All!h says:
"They (Jews and Christians) took their Rabbis and their monks to be
their lords besides Allah (by obeying them in things which they made
lawful or unlawful according to their own desires without being ordered
by Allah), and (they also took as their lord) Messiah, son of Maryam
(Mary), while they (Jews and Christians) were commanded (in the Torah
and the Gospel) to worship none but One Jliih (God i.e., Allah), lii iliiha
ii/ii Huwa (none has the right to be worshipped but He). Praise and

Glory is to Him (far above is He) from having the partners they associate
(with Him)." (V.9:31 ).
Once, while Allah's Messenger rLJ ",!l;: ..:ii 1 ~ was reciting the above Verse,
'Adi bin Hatim said, "O Allah's Prophet! They do not worship them (rabbis and
monks)." Allah's Messenger said, "They certainly do. They (i.e. Rabbis and
monks) made legal things illegal, and illegal things legal, and they (i.e. Jews and
Christians) followed them; and by doing so they really worshipped
them."(Narrated by Ahmad, At-Tirmidhi, and Jbn Jarir). (Taftir At-Tabari,
Vol.10, Page No. 114).
(d)

Shirk-al-Mahabbah. This implies showing the love which is due to Allah
Alone to others than Him.

Almighty Allah says:
"And of mankind are some who take (for worship) others besides Allah
as rivals (to Allah). They love them as they love Allah. But those who
believe, love Allah more (than anything else). If only those who do
wrong could see, when they will see the torment, that all power belongs
to Allah and that Allah is Severe in punishment." (V. 2: 165)
(2) Ash-Shirk-al-Asghar Ar-Riyd' (The minor Shirk, i.e. acts performed to
show off). Any act of worship or any religious deed done in order to gain
praise, fame or for worldly benefit, falls under this catagory.

Almighty Allah says:

rJ

"Say (0 Muhammad
",!l;: ..» 1 ~ ) : 'I am only a man like you, it has
been revealed to me that your I/ah (God) is One Jldh (God - i.e Allah).
So whoever hopes for the meeting with his Lord, let him work
righteousness and associate none as a partner in the worship of his
Lord.'" (V. 18:110)
(3) Ash-Shirk-al-Khafi (The inconspicuous Shirk). This type implies being

inwardly dissatisfied with the inevitable condition that has been ordained for
one by Allah; conscientiously lamenting that had you done or not done such and
such or had you approached such and such you would have had a better status,
etc.
The Noble Prophet Muhammad

rJ ",!l;: ..»

said:

"Ash-Shirk-al-Khafi in the Muslim nation is more inconspicuous than
the creeping of a black ant on black rock in the pitch-darkness of the
night." And this inconspicuous Shirk is expiated by saying thrice the
following sentences every day: "O Allah! I take Your refuge from that I
should ascribe anything as partner in Your worship, being conscious of
that, and I beg Your pardon for that sin which I am not aware of."

There are two aspects of disbelief:
(1). The major disbelief (Al-Kufr-al-Akbar): This aspect excludes one
completely from the fold of Islam. There are five types (of this major
disbelief):-

(a)

Kufr-at-Takdhib. This implies disbelieving the divine truth or denying of
any of the articles of Faith.

Almighty Allah says:
"Then who does more wrong than one who utters a lie against Allah and
denies the truth [this Qur'an, the Prophet (Muhammad
~ .j, 1 ~ ) ,
the Islamic Monotheism,] when it comes to him. Is there not in Hell an
abode for the disbelievers?" (V. 39:32)

rJ

(b)

Kufr-al-Ibd' wat-Takabbur ma'at-Tasdiq. This implies rejection and
arrogance to submit to Allah's Commandments after conviction of their
truth.

Almighty Allah says:
"And (remember) when We said to the angels: 'Prostrate yourself before
Adam.' And they prostrated except lb/is, he refused and was proud and
was one of the disbelievers (disobedient to Allah)." (V. 2:34).
(c)

Kufr-ash-Shakk waz-Zann. This implies doubting or lacking of conviction
in the six articles of Faith.

Almighty Allah says:
"And he went into his garden while in a state (of pride and disbelief)
unjust to himself. He said: 'I think not that this will ever perish. And I
think not the Hour will ever come, and if indeed I am brought back to
my Lord (on the Day of Resurrection) I surely shall find better than this

with my Lord.'" (V.18:35-38)
(d)

Kufr-a/-J'rad. This implies turning away from the truth knowingly or
deviating from the obvious signs which Allah has revealed.

Almighty Allah says:
"We created not the heavens and the earth and all that is between them
except with truth and for an appointed term. But those who disbelieve
tum away from that whereof they are warned." (V.46:3)
(e)

Ku.fr-an-Nifaq. This implies hypocritical disbelief.

Almighty Allah says:
"They have made their oaths a screen (for their hypocrisy). Thus they
hinder (men) from the Path of Allah. Verily, evil is what they used to do.
That is because they believed, then disbelieved, therefore their hearts are
sealed, so they understand not." (V.63:2-3)
(2) The minor disbelief (Al-K,efr-a/-Asghar): This aspect of disbelief does not
exclude one from the fold of Islam. It is also termed Kufrdn-Ni 'mah. This
implies disbelief manifesting itself in ungratefulness for Allah's Blessings or
Favours.
Almighty Allah says:
'And Allah puts forward the example of a township (Makkah), that dwelt
secure and well-content; its provision coming to it in abundance from
every place, but it (its people) denied the Favours of Allah (with
ungratefulness). So Allah made it taste extreme of hunger (famine) and
fear, because of that (evil, i.e. denying Prophet Muhammad~ ..:U I j..o
rl---') which they (its people) used to do." (V.16: 112).

An-Nifaq (Hypocrisy)

An-Nijaq
HYPOCRISY AND ITS VARIOUS MANIFESTATIONS
Hypocrisy is of two types, namely:
(A) Hypocrisy in Belief.
(B) Hypocrisy in deeds and actions.
(A) Hypocrisy in Belief
There are six aspects of hypocrisy in Belief:
I.To belie the Messenger (Muhammad ,..i-.,

'-,!l; .::U t ..,i...)

2.To belie some of all that was brought by the Messenger (Muhammad ..,i...
,..i-., ~ .::U 1) (e.g. the Qur'an, the Sunnah, laws and principles oflslam).
3.To hate the Messenger (Muhammad ,..i-.,

~ .::U t

..,i...).

4.To hate some of that which was brought by the Messenger (Muhammad ..,i...
,.i..., ~ .::U 1). e.g. Islamic Monotheism, etc.
5.To feel happy at the disgrace of or the set back for the religion of Allah's
Messenger (Muhammad ,..i-., ~ .::U t ..,i...).
6.To dislike that the religion of Allah's Messenger (Islamic Monotheism)
becomes victorious. (not being pleased at the victory of Islam).
A person having these six types (of hypocrisy) will be in the lowest depths
(grade) of the Fire (Hell). (See V. 4: 145).
(B) Hypocrisy in deeds and actions
There are five aspects of hypocrisy in deeds and actions, and their proof is from
the statement of Allah's Messenger ,.i..., ~ .::U t ..,i... :- The signs of a hypocrite
are these:
I . Whenever he speaks, he tells a lie.
2. Whenever he promises, he always breaks it (his promise).
3. If you trust him, he proves to be dishonest (if you keep something as
trust with him, he will not return it).
4. And in another narration of the Prophet ,..i-., ~ .::U t ..,i... : Whenever he
quarrels, he behaves in a very imprudent, evil, insulting manner.
5. Whenever he makes a covenant, he proves himself treacherous.

IN THE BIBLE AND THE QUR' AN
BIBLICAL EVIDENCE OF JESUS BEING A SERVANT OF GOD AND
HA YING NO SHARE IN DIVINITY
By Dr. M.T. Al-Hilali, Ph.D.
Professor oflslamic Faith and Teachings, Islamic University, Al-Madinah AlMunawarrah.

INTRODUCTION
All praise is to the One to Whom all Dignity, Honour and Glory are due; the
Unique with perfect attributes, Who begets not, nor is He begotten. He has no
equal but He is the Almighty, Omnipotent. He sent His Messengers and
Prophets to guide humanity towards monotheism; to worship Him Alone, the
only One Worthy of worship, and to warn them of the eternal dire consequences
of polytheism, associating partners with One Allah and the worship of creatures.
Peace and Blessings of Allah be upon all the Prophets and Messengers,
especially on Muhammad, the last of the Prophets, and on all who follow him in
righteousness until the Day of Recompense.

JESUS AND THE DEVIL IN THE BIBLE
In the New Testament of the Bible, in the fourth chapter of the Gospel
according to Matthew, the sixth and seventh verses clearly indicate that Jesus is
an obedient mortal and God is the Master and Lord according to his saying in
the seventh verse:
"It is written again, Thou shalt not tempt the Lord, thy God."

In this chapter we read that the Devil actually carried the Messiah, and took
him from place to place. How can the Devil carry God? Glory be to Allah; He is
above such blasphemy!
Then the Devil orders him to prostrate before him and worship him, even
tempting him with worldly possessions. How can the Devil even dare such an
audacity with God? When the Devil wanted Jesus to comply with his orders, he
(Jesus) replied by saying that it was written (in the previous Books):
"Thou shalt worship the Lord, thy God; And Him only shalt thou serve."
- Matthew 4: I 0.

CHILDREN OF GOD

Jesus never called himself Son of God as far as I know - but he used to call
himself the 'Son of Man' (Mark 2:10) although he heard himself being called
by that name he did not object - as assumed in the Bible - and did not
consider the title exclusively for him.
According to the Biblical term in the Old and New Testaments, every Godfearing righteous person is called 'Son of God'. In Matthew 5:9 we read:
"Blessed are the peace-makers, for they shall be called the children of
God."
In Matthew 5:45 "That ye may be children of your Father which is in heaven ... "
GOD THE FATHER

In Matthew 5:48"Be ye therefore perfect, even as your Father which is in heaven is
perfect."
In Matthew 6: 1 " ... otherwise ye have no reward of your Father which is in heaven."
Matthew 7:21 "Not every one that sayeth unto me (Jesus), Lord, Lord, shall enter into
the kingdom of heaven: but he that doeth the will ofmy Father, which is
in heaven."
N.B. The word 'Lord' here was translated as Rabb in the Arabic version of the
Bible so that people may be convinced that Jesus is God! But if one studies the
rest of the verse, one will note that the verse bears testimony to the subservience
(to God's Will) of the Messiah (Jesus). Therefore the correct translation should
be:

"Not every one that sayeth to me, 0 my Master, shall enter into the
kingdom of heaven, but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in
heaven."

It is obvious from the above readings from the Bible that the term 'Father' is
used for God in numerous places in the Bible. It is never used exclusively for
Jesus.
Matthew 1 I :25 "At that time Jesus answered and said, 'I thank Thee, 0 Father, Lord of
heaven and earth, because Thou hast hid these things from the wise and
prudent and has revealed them unto babes."'

JESUS THE WORSHIPPER
Matthew 14:23 "And when he had sent the multitudes away, he went up into a mountain
apart to pray ..... "
I say: If Jesus is God or a part of God then why did he pray? In fact, prayer
is always from a submitting, needy and dependent one for the Mercy of
Almighty Allah as mentioned in the Qur'iin:
"O mankind! it is you who stand in need of Allah but Allah is Rich (Free
of all wants and needs), Worthy of all praise" (V .35: 15).
And in V.19:93 ofthe Qur'iin:"There is none in the heavens and the earth but comes unto the Most
Gracious (Allah) as a slave."

A BIBLICAL STORY
Matthew 15:22-28 "And, behold, a woman of Canaan came out of the same coasts and cried
unto him, saying, 'Have mercy on me, 0 Lord, thou son of David: my
daughter is grievously vexed with a devil.' But he answered her not a
word. And his disciples came and besought him, saying; 'Send her away,
for she crieth after us.' But he answered and said, 'I am not sent but unto
the lost sheep ofthe house of Israel.'
Then came she and worshipped him, saying, 'Lord, help me.' But he
answered and said, 'It is not meet to take the children's bread and to cast
it to dogs.'
And she said, 'Truth, Lord: yet the dogs eat of the crumbs which fall
from their masters' table.'
Then Jesus answered and said unto her, 'O woman, great is thy faith: be
it unto thee even as thou wilt. And her daughter was made whole from
that very hour.' "
In this story about a woman from Canaan there are noteworthy points:
(1)

Lack of mercy and love charged against Jesus (if the incident is reported
correctly).

(2)

Degraded discrimination in regard to the uplifting of his tribe and not for
the others.

(3)

Tribal pride of descendance and prejudice against others and calling them
dogs.

(4)

An ignorant polytheist woman debated with him and won him over.

JESUS: A PROPHET OF ALUH.
Matthew 19:16-17"And behold, one came and said unto him, 'Good master, what good
thing shall I do that I may have eternal life?' And he said unto him,

Jesus and Muhammad (lleacc 11e ...... - ~

'Why callest thou me good? (There is) none good but one, (i.e.) God,
but if thou wilt enter into life, keep the commandments.' "
In the above verses we note this acknowledgment of his submissiveness (to
Allah's Will).
Matthew 21 :45-46 "And when the chief priests and pharisees had heard his parable, they
perceived that he spoke of them. But when they sought to lay hands on
him, they feared the multitude because they took him for a Prophet."
Here it is proved that all those who believed in Jesus during his life-time did
not believe in him being God or the Son of God or one in the doctrine of
Trinity; but they believed in him as being a Prophet only. This is indeed one of
the strongest points of evidence against those who believe in the Divinity of
Jesus (Incarnation of God) if only they pondered.

JESUS: A SERVANT OF ALLaH.
Matthew 23:8 'But be not ye called Rabbi: for one is your master, even Jesus, and all
ye are brethem."
Here it is clearly proved that Jesus was servant of Allah, and that there is
only One Master and He is Allah. In the Arabic version of the Bible this verse
has been translated so that Jesus is meant to be the master whereas the English
rendering is nearer the original sense.
Matthew 23 :9 "And call no man your father upon the earth: for one is your Father
which is in heaven."
From this you will note that fatherhood and sonship is meant to be the
relationship between the Lord and His servants: it is meant in a general sense
and not specifically for Jesus.
Matthew 24:36 "But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of heaven,
but my Father only."
This is a definite proof that the Final Hour is unknown to any but Allah, thus
Jesus' knowledge is imperfect like all other men; Allah Alone is All-Knowing,
Omniscient.
Matthew 26:39 "And he (Jesus) went a little farther, and fell on his face and prayed,
saying, 'O my Father, if it be possible, let this cup pass from me:
nevertheless not as I will, but as Thou wilt.' "
We note here that the person speaking is unaware of Allah's Will and
realizes the fact that he is a servant of Allah. He (Allah) Alone can cause the
change.
THE COMPILATION OF THE BIBLE

Jesus and Muhammad (pea••"" upon th<mJ.

Matthew 27:7-8 "And they took counsel and bought with them the potter's field to bury
strangers in. Wherefore that field was called the Field of Blood, unto this
day."
From these verses we understand that the Bible (the New Testament) was
not written during Jesus' life-time but long after the occurrence of the events
described, having been retained in the memory of the people.
Matthew 27:46 "And about the ninth hour Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, 'Eli,Eli,
lama sabachthani? (My God, My God, why hast Thou forsaken me?')"
This is according to their (Christians') assumption that Jesus cried in a loud
voice saying the above words while he was being crucified. This is a great insult
as such words could only come from unbelievers in Allah. Further, it is
incredible that such words should come out from a Prophet of Allah because
Allah never breaks His Promise and His Prophets never complained against His
Promise.
JESUS: PREACHER OF MONOTHEISM (TAUHID)
In John 17:3 "And this is life eternal, that they might know Thee, the only true God,
and Jesus Christ whom Thou has sent."
In Mark 12:28-30"And one of the scribes came, and having heard them reasoning
together, and perceiving that he had answered them well, asked him,
'Which is the first commandment of all?' And Jesus answered him: 'The
first of all the commandments is; hear O Israel, the Lord thy God is One
Lord: and thou shalt love the Lord, thy God with all thy heart, and with
all thy soul, and with all thy mind, and with all thy strength: this is the
first commandment.' "
In Mark 12:32"And the scribe said unto him, 'Well, Master, thou hast said the truth:
for there is One God; and there is none other but He.' "
In Mark 12:34 " ... he (Jesus) said unto him, 'Thou art not far from the kingdom of
God ... '"
In these verses, Jesus (peace be upon him) himself had testified that Allah is
the One God, there is none other than Him, and that whoever believes in His
Oneness, he is near the Kingdom of Allah. Therefore whoever associates
partners with Allah or believes in the Trinity is far away from the Kingdom of
Allah, and whoever is far away from the Kingdom of Allah he is the enemy of
Allah.
In Matthew 24:36 -

Jesus and Muhammad (peace be upoa 11,em).

"But of that day and hour knoweth no man, no, not the angels of the
heaven, but my Father only."
I say: A similar text was quoted from Matthew which is exactly as
proclaimed by the Qur'iin in that none knows when the Hour will come except
Alliih. This establishes the fact that Jesus was subservient to Alliih and that he
had no share in Divinity: that he was an incarnation of God, was an innovation
by the people of Canaan.
In John 20: 16 "Jesus said unto her, 'Mary'. She turned herself, and sayeth unto him,
'Rabboni', which is to say, Master, Jesus saith unto her, 'Touch me not:
For I am not yet ascended to my Father; but go to my brethren, and say
unto them, I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and to my God and
your God.' Mary Magdalene came and told the disciples that she has
seen the Lord, and that He had spoken these things unto her."
In the above narrative Jesus clearly testified that Alliih is his God and their
God, making no difference between him and them in the worship of the One
Alliih. Whoever believes that Jesus is God has indeed blasphemed against Alliih
and betrayed Jesus and all the Prophets and Messengers of Alliih.
BIBLICAL PROPHECY ON THE ADVENT OF

r---'

John 14:15-16-

"Ifyou love me, keep my commandments. And I will pray the Father and
He shall give you another Comforter that he may abide with you
forever."
Muslim theologians have said that "another Comforter" is Muhammad, the
Messenger of Alliih; and him to "abide forever" means the perpetuity of his
laws and way of life (Shari'ah) and the Book (Qur'iin) which was revealed to
him.
John 15:26-27 "But when the Comforter is come, whom I will send unto you from the
Father, even the Spirit of truth, which proceedeth from the Father, he
shall testify of me: And ye also shall bear witness, because ye have been
with me from the beginning."
John 16:5-8 -

"But now I go my way to Him that sent me and none of you asketh me
'Whither goest thou?' But because I have said these things unto you,
sorrow hath filled your heart. Nevertheless I tell you the truth; for if I go
not away, the Comforter will not come unto you; but if I depart, I will
send him unto you. And when he is come, he will reprove the world of
sin, and approve righteousness and judgment."

"I have yet many things to say unto you, but you cannot bear them now.
How be it when he, the Spirit of truth, is come, he will guide you into all
truth: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that
shall he speak; and he will shew you things to come. He shall glorify me:
for he shall receive of mine, and he shall shew it unto you."
John 16:16"A little while and ye shall not see me: and again a little while, ye shall
see me, because I go to the Father."
Muslim theologians have stated that the person who is described by Jesus to
come after him - in the above verses - does not comply with any other
person but Muhammad rl-'J 41': ..ii 1 .,..i.., the Messenger of Allah. This 'person'
whom Jesus prophesied will come after him is called in the Bible 'Parqaleeta'
This word was deleted by later interpreters and translators and changed at times
to 'Spirit of Truth', and at other times, to 'Comforter' and sometimes to 'Holy
Spirit'. The original word is Greek and its meaning is 'one whom people praise
exceedingly.' The sense of the word is applicable to the word 'Muhammad' (in
Arabic).
FINALITY OF PROOFS ON THE FABRICATION
OF THE STORY OF THE CROSS

(1) The Bible testifies to the fact that Jesus was known among the Jews; he used
to preach and deliver sermons in the Temple of Solomon in Jerusalem. It was
therefore, unnecessary to hire a Jew for thirty pieces of silver to direct them to
him as related in Matthew.
(2) It is related that one of the twelve disciples named Judas Iscariot was hired
to direct the Jews to Jesus. They then sentenced him after which Judas was
greatly ashamed and dissociated himself from their act and then committed
suicide. All this took place within twenty four hours. The contradictions are
obvious.
(3) The clearest proof which alone is sufficient to discredit this story is when
the Jews passed the sentence of death against Jesus and intended to get the
approval of the governor, Pontius Pilate.
Matthew 27:11-14, And Jesus stood before the governor: The governor asked him, saying,
'Art thou the king of the Jews!' And Jesus said unto him, 'Thou sayest':
And when he was accused of (by) the chief priests and elders he
answered nothing. Then said Pilate unto him, 'Hearest thou not how
many things they witness against thee?' And he answered him never (to)
a word ... "
The Christians will interpret the above verse to mean that Jesus wanted to
die on the Cross for the redemption of mankind and for the forgiveness of their
sins. If so, then why did he ask to tum away that cup from him (i.e. death)? Why
did he cry out while on the Cross (as they assume): "O Lord, why hast Thou
forsaken me?" How could he have remained silent when the truth was being

Jesus and Muhammad (peau be upon 1hem,

challenged? He was known for his soul-inspiring sermons challenging the
learned Jewish Rabbis. No sane person can believe in this. If the story of the
Cross is disproved then the very foundation on which Christianity is based, will
be demolished.
Muslims believe that Jesus was not crucified by the Jews as revealed in the
Holy Qur'an by Allah in a crystal clear manner: V. 4: 157, 158."And because of their saying (in boast): 'We killed Messiah Jesus, son
of Mary, the Messenger of Allah'; - but they killed him not, nor
crucified him, but the resemblance of Jesus was put over another man
(and they killed that man), and those who differ therein are full of
doubts. They have no (certain) knowledge, they follow nothing but
conjecture. For surely, they killed him not (i.e., Jesus, son of Mary). But
Allah raised him (Jesus) up (with his body and soul) unto Himself (and
he r)L.JI ~ is in the heavens) .. And Allah is Ever All-Powerful, AllWise."
The Jews themselves, together with the entire Christian world, believe that
he was crucified. As proofs against their views and to prove the truth of the
Muslim verdict through the Bible, I prepared the following set of questions
based on the Book of Matthew in the New Testament of the Bible. (Chapters
26 and 27):
(l) Did those who captured Jesus (according to their assumption) know him in
person? or did they not know him?

Matthew testifies that they did not know him.
(2) Was it during the day or night that he was captured?
Matthew says -

it was during the night.

(3) Who was the one that directed them to him?
Matthew says: He was one of his twelve disciples called Judas Iscariot.
(4) Did he direct them free of charge or for a fixed reward which they specified,
for him?
Matthew says: He directed them to him for a fixed reward of thirty pieces of
silver.
(5) What was the condition of Jesus during that night?
Matthew says: He was fearful and prostrated in prayer saying: "O God, if it
is possible for You to let this cup pass from me, then let it pass." It is incredible
that such words could come from a believer in God, let alone a Prophet of God,
because all believers believe that God has power over all things.
(6) What was the condition of his eleven disciples?
Matthew says: Sleep overcame them that night together with their teacher
(according to their assumption) out of fear.
(7) Was Jesus contented with their condition?

Appendix II

912

Matthew says (verses 40-46): He was not satisfied. He used to come to them
to wake them up saying: "Watch and pray, that ye enter not into temptation; the
spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak." Then he would come again to find
them asleep and he would again wake them up and say the same thing. This
weakness could not have been spoken of righteous pupils even if they were
pupils ofan ordinary pious teacher, let alone the disciples of Jesus, son of Mary.
(8) Did they help him when those ruffians captured him?
Matthew says: They forsook him and fled.
(9) Did Jesus have confidence in his disciples that night?
Matthew says: Jesus informed them that they will all forsake him. Then
Jesus said unto them: "Verily I say unto thee that this night before the cock
crows, thou shall deny me- thrice." Peter said unto him, "Although l should
die with thee, yet will I not deny thee." Likewise also said all the disciples. And
so it happened.
(10) How did those ruffians capture him?
Matthew says: They came to him with swords and staves after they were
directed to him by a Jew, then they captured him as described in verse 57:
"And they that had laid hold on Jesus, led him away to Caiaphas the high
priest, where the elders were assembled."
There they passed the sentence of death on him. The ruffians then took him
away, spat on his face and struck him with their hands after which they stripped
him of his clothes and clad him in scarlet robes, then placed a crown of thorns
on his head and took him about, teasing and mocking him. They said to him:
'You are the king of Israel according to your claim.' They severely degraded
him.
(11) Who finally decided to pass the death sentence against him?
Matthew says: He was Pontius Pilate, who was at that time the governor of
Palestine.
(12) When the ruffians brought that man before the governor and informed him
that the priest of the Jews passed the sentence of death by crucifixion according
to their law (Torah), did he believe in them without investigation?
Matthew says: He did not believe them but asked that man: "ls it true what
they have said?" He remained silent. The question was repeated and he
continued to remain silent. He remained silent in view of the truth; it was
essential for him even if he was not a Prophet to clarify the truth and deny the
false accusation of the Jews. The governor's wife went to the governor and she
said to him: "Have thou nothing to do with that just man? for I have suffered
many things this day in a dream because of him."
The Bible states that Jesus delivered lengthy speeches to the Jews rebuking
and warning them which amounted to defaming them. Then why was he silent
that day? The governor's intention for asking him was to stand for the truth.
(13) How was he crucified according to their assumption?
www.holybooks.com

Appendix II

913

Jesus and Muhammad (peace be • . - .-J.

Matthew says: They crucified him between two thieves both of whom
abused him by saying to him, "lfyou are truthful then save yourself."
(14) This was a great calamity. What did he say while on the cross (according to
their assumption)?
Matthew says (27:46):
Jesus cried with a loud voice, saying, "Eli, Eli, lama sabachthani? (that
is to say,) my God, my God, why hast Thou forsaken me?"
This is a blatant declaration of disbelief according to all theological
authorities. Whoever relates it to a Prophet is a disbeliever according to the
revealed religions.
Almighty Allah, in the Qur'iin warns, the Jews and the Christians against
their blasphemy; that Jesus is an incarnation of God (Allah) or the son of God
(Allah) or in rejecting him totally; and that they must believe in him as a
Messenger of Allah only:
"And there is none of the people of the Scripture (Jews and Christians)
but must believe in him (Jesus, son of Mary, as only a Messenger of
Allah and a human being) before his (Jesus r'.>l.-JI ~ or a Jew's or a
Christian's) death (at the time of the appearance of the angel of death).
And on the Day of Resurrection, he (Jesus) will be a witness against
them." (V.4: 159).
